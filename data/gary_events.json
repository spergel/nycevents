      "description": "Learn how Julio Alvarez - TEDx speaker & creator of \"Braving Big Tech\" - is leading with humanity in an AI world. Discover why he thinks leadership needs less perfection & more truth, & see how failure can be turned into fuel for founders who are building technology as authentic leaders.\r Julio Alvarez has seen the inside of Silicon Valley's biggest names, from Apple to Google. He's launched products used by millions, & he's also been fired four times. \r Four. Times. \r Those experiences -- the highs & the lows -- have shaped his perspective on what it takes to lead. Especially now in this uncertain environment.\r Many founders building in AI focus on the technical side -- the code & the algorithms. But what about the human side? What happens when you face setbacks, when the path isn't clear? \r Julio's story shows that failure isn't the end. Failure can be a starting point.\r On March 25th, explore with Julio how to build AI startups that prioritize people, both within your team & in your product. You'll learn how to navigate challenges, build resilience, & lead with authenticity in a rapidly changing tech landscape. \r Discover how to turn your own experiences -- even the difficult ones -- into a foundation for innovation & lasting impact.\r Tickets for this event include food & drinks, as well as exclusive access to this transformative entrepreneur who will show you how to:\r Transform setbacks into strategic advantages.\r Build AI startups that prioritize human connection.\r Lead with authenticity in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.\r Develop resilience for navigating the challenges of entrepreneurship.\r Incorporate emotional intelligence into your leadership style.\r You'll also meet dozens of other high-performing entrepreneurs who are creating their next big thing. Seriously, it's some of the best founder networking in the city.\r Getting a ticket guarantees admission. No waitlisting.\r We're meeting LIVE AND IN-PERSON at The Yard, a coworking space at the intersection of innovation, creativity, design, & play -- with locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Philly, & DC -- with a variety of shared & private workspace options. If you are interested in learning more or scheduling a visit, you can do so here.\r And don't miss our recurring founder social events over coffee or cocktails.

Discover why he thinks leadership needs less perfection & more truth, & see how failure can be turned into fuel for founders who are building technology as authentic leaders.\r Julio Alvarez has seen the inside of Silicon Valley's biggest names, from Apple to Google. He's launched products used by millions, & he's also been fired four times. \r Four. Times. \r Those experiences -- the highs & the lows -- have shaped his perspective on what it takes to lead. Especially now in this uncertain environment.\r Many founders building in AI focus on the technical side -- the code & the algorithms. But what about the human side?

You'll learn how to navigate challenges, build resilience, & lead with authenticity in a rapidly changing tech landscape. \r Discover how to turn your own experiences -- even the difficult ones -- into a foundation for innovation & lasting impact.\r Tickets for this event include food & drinks, as well as exclusive access to this transformative entrepreneur who will show you how to:\r Transform setbacks into strategic advantages.\r Build AI startups that prioritize human connection.\r Lead with authenticity in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.\r Develop resilience for navigating the challenges of entrepreneurship.\r Incorporate emotional intelligence into your leadership style.\r You'll also meet dozens of other high-performing entrepreneurs who are creating their next big thing.

      "description": "Computational Techniques For Making Karaoke Harder\rThe world is hurtling toward a crisis: karaoke is getting too easy. Safety researchers now project that by the year 2030, everyone will be bored of every song & the karaoke industry will collapse, setting off a domino effect that destroys civilization in an event known as the Karaokalypse.\r Hosted by Numeric, your AI-assistant across the entire accounting lifecycle, Jamie Brew (The Onion, ClickHole, Botnik, RC W2 2019) will present humanity's last hope: The Weird Algorithm, a state-of-the-art system for making karaoke harder by changing the words but keeping the melody. Given an input song, it replaces the lyrics with fragments of text from specific datasets (e.g. Craigslist ads for old cars, Yelp reviews of psychics & the script of Mean Girls) to create a new song that has never been sung before & will never be sung again.\r Through a series of demos & deep dives, we'll cover a range of karaoke hardening techniques from the fields of natural language processing (NLP), artificial \"intelligence\" (A\"I\") & showbiz. We'll look at how to collect, annotate & model data for procedural use, & at how the software project has grown in tandem with the live show. We'll consider some alternative metaphors for text generation besides \"the machine is a person\" & address the urgent question of whether it's ethical to work on anything other than avant-garde karaoke research. Singing along will be optional, encouraged, & nearly impossible.\r Numeric is the AI-powered close management platform. Organize your close, streamline reconciliations, & leverage AI for auto-drafted flux analysis + reporting. Spend less time on the manual, & more time on the impactful.",

Safety researchers now project that by the year 2030, everyone will be bored of every song & the karaoke industry will collapse, setting off a domino effect that destroys civilization in an event known as the Karaokalypse.\r Hosted by Numeric, your AI-assistant across the entire accounting lifecycle, Jamie Brew (The Onion, ClickHole, Botnik, RC W2 2019) will present humanity's last hope: The Weird Algorithm, a state-of-the-art system for making karaoke harder by changing the words but keeping the melody. Given an input song, it replaces the lyrics with fragments of text from specific datasets (e.g. Craigslist ads for old cars, Yelp reviews of psychics & the script of Mean Girls) to create a new song that has never been sung before & will never be sung again.\r Through a series of demos & deep dives, we'll cover a range of karaoke hardening techniques from the fields of natural language processing (NLP), artificial \"intelligence\" (A\"I\") & showbiz. We'll look at how to collect, annotate & model data for procedural use, & at how the software project has grown in tandem with the live show. We'll consider some alternative metaphors for text generation besides \"the machine is a person\" & address the urgent question of whether it's ethical to work on anything other than avant-garde karaoke research. Singing along will be optional, encouraged, & nearly impossible.\r Numeric is the AI-powered close management platform. Organize your close, streamline reconciliations, & leverage AI for auto-drafted flux analysis + reporting. Spend less time on the manual, & more time on the impactful.",

Each installment of the MVP Feature Series, located at 11 Times Square, will feature two talks by MVPs & an hour of networking with the developer community!\r Session Title: Why M365 product development is different from project development\r Presenter: Peter Ward\r While products are designed to meet customers' needs & desires, projects are established to achieve specific goals or objectives. This difference is not widely understood by enterprise or Microsoft partner development teams. This session explains:\r Why agile is widely used in product development environments & less widely used in project development environments.\rWhen it makes sense to build a product for the Microsoft store.\rWhat development teams need to understand when developing a product?\r-How to define the development scope?\rHow to make a product a commercial success?\rAt the end of the session, attendees will understand that there is a big difference between the business model & decision process in a product versus project development environment.",

This difference is not widely understood by enterprise or Microsoft partner development teams. This session explains:\r Why agile is widely used in product development environments & less widely used in project development environments.\rWhen it makes sense to build a product for the Microsoft store.\rWhat development teams need to understand when developing a product?\r-How to define the development scope?\rHow to make a product a commercial success?\rAt the end of the session, attendees will understand that there is a big difference between the business model & decision process in a product versus project development environment.",

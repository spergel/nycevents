In order to sufficiently address tech's inequities, simply put: we need to follow the money.\r Join us on Thursday, March 6th for the launch of Catherine Bracy's new book World Eaters: an examination of venture capital, how it drives growth above wellbeing, & how we can change this model for sustainable, responsible growth. We'll hear remarks from the author herself as well as Felicia Wong, Principal, Roosevelt Institute, & Janet Haven, Executive Director, Data & Society Research Institute.

And in World Eaters, Catherine Bracy offers a window into the pernicious aspects of VC & shows us how its bad practices are bleeding into all industries, undermining the labor & housing markets & posing unique dangers to the economy at large. VC's creates a wide, powerful wake that impacts the average consumer just as much as it does investors & entrepreneurs.\r In researching this book, Bracy has interviewed founders, fund managers, contract & temp workers in the gig economy, & Limited Partners across the landscape. She learned that the current VC model is not a good fit for the majority of start-ups, & yet, there are too few options for early stage funding outside of VC dollars. And while there are some alternative paths for sustainable, responsible growth, without the help of regulators, there is not much motivation to drive investors from the roulette table that is venture capital.\r World Eaters is an eye-opening account of the ways that the values of contemporary venture capital hurt founders, consumers, & the market. Bracy's clear-eyed debut is a must-read for fans of Winners Take All, Super Pumped, & Brotopia, an appealing insider / outsider perspective on Silicon Valley, & those who are fascinated to look under the hood & learn why the modern economy is not working for most of us.\r ----------------\r We enforce a Code of Conduct at our events.

Benjamin is a sociologist & scholar of race, technology, & justice, while Crawford is an AI researcher & expert on the social & political impacts of artificial intelligence. Hosted by our Director of Publishing Joshua Jelly-Schapiro, they will discuss the growing prevalence of AI, & its impact, for the next session of Science & Society.\r In an age of rampant techno-optimism (and growing techno-anxiety), AI is playing an ever-more central role in how we live, work, think & play: in the conduct of government, in the futures we imagine for ourselves & our species. How should we understand the biases baked into large language models, & other large data sets? How can we best demystify & account for the real & human costs of new technologies & the infrastructures they need? Who controls our data, & governs its use? What potentials exist for using AI, & other technologies, as tools not for bolstering extant iniquities but advancing justice?\r After the conversation, join us in the garden for stargazing with the Amateur Astronomers Association. Eritrean-Ethiopian food will be available for purchase throughout the evening by Makina Cafe. Please note that seating is limited & will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis.\r About the speakers\r Ruha Benjamin is a distinguished sociologist & transdisciplinary scholar at the intersections of science, technology, medicine, & society, with a particular focus on how innovation can perpetuate or mitigate social inequities. She holds the position of Alexander Stewart 1886 Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University & is the founding director of the Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab, an initiative that seeks to harness data as a tool for justice. Her postdoctoral work includes fellowships at UCLA's Institute for Society & Genetics & Harvard University's Science, Technology, & Society Program. Throughout her career, Benjamin has authored several impactful books that explore the complex relationships between race, technology, & justice, including People's Science: Bodies & Rights on the Stem Cell Frontier (2013), Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code (2019), Viral Justice: How We Grow the World We Want (2022), & Imagination: A Manifesto (2024). Benjamin was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2024.\r Kate Crawford is a research professor at USC Annenberg, a Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research New York, & a leading scholar on the social & political impacts of artificial intelligence. She is the author of Atlas of AI: Power, Politics & the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence (winner of the Sally Hacker Prize), which explores how AI systems are shaped by history, power, & material resources. Crawford is also a co-founder of the Knowing Machines Project, investigating the epistemology of machine learning. Her latest work, Calculating Empires, spans exhibitions in Tokyo, Paris, Barcelona, Gijn, & Prague, examining the intersections of AI, governance, & global infrastructures.\r Ruha Benjamin & Kate Crawford will be in conversation hosted by Joshua-Jelly Schapiro.\r Joshua Jelly-Schapiro is a geographer & writer, & he is Director of Publishing at Pioneer Works & the Executive Editor of Pioneer Works Broadcast. His books include Names of New York: Discovering the City's Past, Present, & Future Through Its Place-Names & Island People: The Caribbean & the World.\r The Science & Society series grapples with our relationships with nature & each other. Each leads us deep into humanity's timely & intersectional challenges, from biodiversity, to plastics, public knowledge, the high seas, farming, climate, & love. The series is supported by the Simons Foundation, & the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Program in Public Understanding of Science & Technology, bridging the two cultures of science & the arts.",

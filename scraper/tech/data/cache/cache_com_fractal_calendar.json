      "description": "\u200bThe Fractal community aims to support its members across multiple facets of life - work, play, and now, health.\u200bWe are launching this initiative to teach community members how to manage their health and navigate the healthcare system. Come to Fractal Tech to discuss the former, those nagging healthcare questions, with a nurse.\u200bYou can sign up for a free appointment to, for example, get feedback on ongoing medical issues, prepare for an upcoming doctor's appointment, or talk through lifestyle changes like diet or exercise.\u200bWe'll kick the event off with a short talk, and then start calling out names for appointments in the backroom, if you signed up for one. If you're not in an appointment, hang out with the rest of the crew and enjoy the healthy snacks, drinks, and people.\u200bDisclaimer:This event is for informational and educational purposes only. The nurse will provide general health information and will not offer personal medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Please consult your own healthcare provider for medical guidance specific to your needs.",

I want everyone building real things\u2014whether that\u2019s embedded systems, wearables, neurotech, robotics, or RF\u2014to actually know each other. The existing meetups haven\u2019t quite hit the mark, so we\u2019re building something better.\u200bJoin a community of engineers, inventors, and builders shaping the future of hardware. Whether you\u2019re debugging a prototype, bringing up a custom board, or just love the smell of solder in the morning, this is your scene.\u200bBring your projects, ideas, or just curiosity. Bonus points if you bring something you built.",

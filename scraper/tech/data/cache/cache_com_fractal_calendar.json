I want everyone building real things\u2014whether that\u2019s embedded systems, wearables, neurotech, robotics, or RF\u2014to actually know each other. The existing meetups haven\u2019t quite hit the mark, so we\u2019re building something better.\u200bJoin a community of engineers, inventors, and builders shaping the future of hardware. Whether you\u2019re debugging a prototype, bringing up a custom board, or just love the smell of solder in the morning, this is your scene.\u200bBring your projects, ideas, or just curiosity. Bonus points if you bring something you built.",

The talk will help you answer questions like: What are premiums and deductibles? What's the difference between an HMO and PPO? How do I figure out if my doctor is covered by my insurance?\u200b\u200bAfter that chat, you can sign up for a free appointment with a nurse to get feedback on ongoing medical issues, prepare for an upcoming doctor's appointment, talk through lifestyle changes like diet or exercise, etc.\u200bThe US healthcare system is complex - we aim to make information about it, and how to navigate it, more digestible and accessible. To learn more about how it all works check out thisWiki.\u200b\u200bDisclaimer: This event is for informational and educational purposes only. The nurse will provide general health information and will not offer personal medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

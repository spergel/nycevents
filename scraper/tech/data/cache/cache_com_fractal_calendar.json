      "description": "\u200bDouble your deal size. Halve your sales cycle. Scale.\u200bA systematic workshop where technical leaders deconstruct live deals using first principles and engineering methodologies to build reliable sales systems that scale.\u200bAbout Your Instructor:\u200bWalter Rothleft college one semester short of completing his engineering degree to raise $9.8M for his first startup at age 23. With experience spanning enterprise sales at Oracle, venture capital as an Entrepreneur-in-Residence, and founding multiple companies, Walter's methodology has quantifiably improved sales metrics for founding teams - doubling average deal size and halving sales cycles within 90 days for venture-backed companies from pre-seed to Series C.\u200bFor Technical Leaders Who:\u200bAre founding engineers playing active roles in sales conversations, future founder / founding team members currently in a sales facing role or founding sales executives\u200bWant a systematic approach instead of relationship-based selling tactics\u200bNeed to build sales processes from scratch without prior playbooks\u200bWhy Builders Make Great Salespeople:\u200bPattern recognition identifies underlying deal structures across products and markets\u200bDiagnostic precision and unit testing finds and fixes problems at the root\u200bSystems thinking transforms isolated customer data points into actionable GTM insights\u200bWorkshop Structure (3 hours):\u200bCommunity & Networking (10 min): Connect with fellow technical leaders tackling similar challenges\u200bIntro (15 min): The first principles of sales (Don't waste time, Deals never lie, The truth will set you free)\u200bDeal Dissection (90 min): Collaborative anatomical review of participant deals using the The 3W Diagnostic Protocol\u200bBreak (5 min)\u200bGTM Reverse Engineering (25 min): Layout the foundation for building your playbook and sales toolkit from the ground up based on findings of your pipeline review\u200bPsychological Debugging (25 min): Identify and overcome the hidden mental barriers that emerged during pipeline reviews - the silent deal killers that haunt founders\u200bCommunity Networking (10 min): Collaborative problem-solving and resource sharing\u200bEfficient Preparation:\u200bBring 1+ active deals to discuss (maintaining confidentiality of names/accounts)\u200bOptional pre-reading: \"How to Build a Successful Founder-Led Sales Strategy\" (https://www.heavybit.com/library/article/founder-led-sales-strategy)\u200bFor maximum value: Access the 100-minute foundational course before the workshop and sales templates\u200bExclusive Opportunities:\u200bFirst 3 registrants: optional pre-workshop sales call review with written feedback\u200bAll registrants: optionally submit a call transcript: 2-3 will be selected (with permission) as workshop case studies\u200bSelected examples: complimentary 30-minute coaching session plus workshop spotlight\u200bSpecific Takeaways:\u200bA pipeline review framework that unit tests deals in about 60 seconds, eliminating false positives that waste your time\u200b5 specific deal diagnostic questions that cut through BS and drives clear next steps\u200b1 slide discovery template that helps you proactively and retroactively fill in missing discovery at the start of every sales call (and gets prospects to thank you for using it)\u200b1 slide demo technique template that helps you give shorter, more compelling demos\u200bA meeting architecture that shifts power dynamics from vendor-customer to strategic collaborative problem-solving\u200bWhat Others Say:\u200b\"Walter helped turn what would have been a 6-figure deal into a 7-figure deal for a developer founder, helping them raise the biggest round of the cohort at a much higher valuation than expected. He helps technical founders cut through the hype to figure out what customers truly need. We're starting to introduce him as soon as possible to our teams. The big thing Walter brings to the table is that he convinces engineers to like sales. They go talk to him, and they come back f'n loving doing sales. Before that, they hated doing sales.\" -Dave, Founder of HF0 and General Partner at Backend Capital\u200b\"You talk to him for 5 minutes and he is already delivering value in your sales process. Without knowing anything contextual about us, he was able to look at the pure mechanics of the sales process and then instantly start moving the needle.\" -Henrik Bennetsen, Co-founder and Chief Business Officer of Canvas Construction\u200b\"What I'm most surprised about is how quickly it was adopted not just by a rep but by the whole team. This helped us structure the chaos in early-stage startups. The engagement paid for itself very quickly in just the three or four months we've worked together. What I'm most excited about, anecdotally and directionally, I can say it's going to be a 5-10X return. Because it's now part of our DNA and approach. It's not just limited to Go-to-market. It's benefiting other functions.\"  -Adnan Iqbal, CEO of Luma Health\u200bMore atSimpleLens.com\u200bLimited to 10-15 participants. Workshop creates accelerated learning through direct application of first principles to live deals.",

Come to Fractal Tech to discuss the former, those nagging healthcare questions, with a nurse.\u200bYou can sign up for a free appointment to get feedback on ongoing medical issues, prepare for an upcoming doctor's appointment, or talk through lifestyle changes like diet or exercise.\u200bWe'll kick the event off with a short talk, and then start calling out names for appointments in the backroom, if you signed up for one. If you're not in an appointment, hang out with the rest of the crew and enjoy the healthy snacks, drinks, and people.\u200bDisclaimer:This event is for informational and educational purposes only. The nurse will provide general health information and will not offer personal medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Please consult your own healthcare provider for medical guidance specific to your needs.",

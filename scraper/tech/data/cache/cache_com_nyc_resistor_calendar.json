Most of all, just getting started, even when, from a materials standpoint, all you need is your smartphone camera.This class will introduce the founding steps to starting a documentary film project, from composing their idea to conversing with potential interviewees. My goal is to help provide clear beginning steps and to alleviate any nervousness around each one. We'll also cover morals and ethics when it comes to documentary as it's personally important for me to discuss.The class won't get into technical skills like camera work or editing. To even get people to a ready stage to pick up a camera is more than enough to cover. Also, documentaries are beautiful in that you don't need to invest into much equipment and people's first docs, I feel it's best not to bring any need to purchase or rent anything.Who is this for?People interested in making their own documentary, whether for themselves or to share a story they're passionate about. No materials or prior experience needed.\n\nYour instructor:\nJared Leong - I'm a documentary filmmaker based out of NYC. Filmed all around the country and internationally as well, focused as a producer/director.\n\nThis is a masks optional workshop.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

If your file ends up being too complicated, we may have you do the class default project first, just to learn the laser in the time allotted - but we'll definitely help you with your more complex cut at a free Craft Night in future!\nAn SVG vector file of a simple shape you'd like to cut for your first cut.A piece of 1/8 inch or thinner wood, acrylic or cardboard you'd like to cut. If you can't bring your own material, small pieces will be made available, or larger pieces for purchase on site.Please be on time for the start of class!

Building your own gear doesn't have to be a solitary hobby anymore... has regular meetups to share recent DIY audio projects (speakers, amps, DACs, etc - anything home-audio related), as well as talks and demos on related topics and skills (how to solder, how digital crossovers work, fabrication techniques, digital room correction, etc).\nThis month we're going to talk about repairs, and cover the basics that anyone who's contracted this audio illness should know - we're talking weekend projects that don't need sophisticated equipment.(Things like refoaming speakers, cleaning scratchy volume pots, repairing cables, replacing capacitors, etc.)Do you have a brief demo you can share? Let us know at diyaudio@gowanusaudio.com and we'll add it to the list.\n(If history is any guide, at the end of the meetup some of us will want to keep talking about projects and we'll move to a bar nearby - join us!)\nWho should come?\nOpen to anyone interested in DIY home audio who wants to learn and make some new friends - all experience levels welcome. If you've ever wanted to build any audio gear, we're here for you. (We generally don't focus on production, live sound, musical instruments, or making music, although there certainly is some overlap.)\nNote from the organizer, Pete:\nI started diyaudio.nyc a couple years ago because I wanted to meet some like-minded folks near me - I knew they were out there. And they are! Thank you for being a part! Let's grow this group! These days, for me, it's all audio all the time - I work as a Buyer for The Music Room buying high end audio equipment, and also offer complete classes to build your own equipment as Gowanus Audio.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 \u2013 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 \u2013 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

      "description": "​So, how do Iactuallymeet someone out in the world?When you are trying to move from apps to dating in real life, fears, questions, awkwardness, and insecurities can come up. This event is all about diving into the tactical of going from swiping to IRL.​Build skills and confidence, while also connecting with others dating in NYC!​How?​🔹IRL Dating Panel Discussion– Hear from IRL dating experts as they share insights on how to navigate real-life interactions.

Check out The Full onInstagram!​What is Met Through Friends?Met Through Friendsstarted as a series of apartment parties for founder Elle Wilson’s real single friends. It began with the insight that she knew so many wonderful, “dateable” people weren’t finding luck on the apps - what would happen if they and their friends got offline and into a room full of others looking for the same thing? Since 2022, it has grown to welcome thousands of friends from across NYC and beyond who are looking for more social, fun ways to connect.Elleis also a certified dating coach who works with individuals who are looking to build meaningful, productive, fun IRL dating lives. If you want more support to get “un-stuck” fast, we’d love to work with you.

      "description": "​Update:We’re sold out! We’ll likely do a second tour in April or May. Follow ourInstagramor subscribe to our luma calendar to hear about the announcement!​——​Join us for a visit to the Lubalin Archives at The Cooper Union.The Lubalin Center preserves the work of Herb Lubalin and other designers through an archive that includes drawings, type specimens, posters, logos, and advertising materials. Lubalin is a goated American Graphic Designer and this growing archive contain works not only by him but also Paul Rand, Milton Glaser, Massimo Vignelli, and many others.​The archive isn’t digitized so you literally won’t be able to find its stuff on are.na, Pinterest, google images etc. We’re moving beyond aesthetics and engaging with materiality and context, folks! As someone who has visited the archives, I’d say it contains some of the best design references in the country.​We’re getting a hands-on presentation of a selection of material which lasts about an hour and a half. It's a closer look at some of the objects in the collection, the stories behind them, and what they can teach us about making work today. The emphasis is on ways we can make active use of design history as contemporary practitioners. The curators will use physical examples from the collection to construct specific case studies of ways we can look at objects to inform today's design decisions.​The Center usually doesn’t host groups past 3 PM, but they’ve graciously agreed to keep the archive open for us until 6 PM on Friday, allowing for a 4 PM start. You may need to leave work a little early, but it’s a Friday and well worth it.",

      "description": "This six-week generative writing workshop explores the interplay between our physical surroundings and inner world. Through direct engagement with public environments, we will observe how walking, loitering, shopping, and commuting can inspire writing. How do these everyday movements shape perception, memory, and narrative?\nObservations and experience will become the foundation for new writing, unfolding into meditative episodes, digressive accounts, and stream-of-consciousness vignettes that capture lived experience and the movement of thought.\nEach session will unfold in three parts: moving through public spaces to observe and gather material, a focused writing period with prompts, and opportunities to share work for those who wish.\nThis class is open to writers and artists of any level interested in deepening their engagement with space, perception, and writing.\nShort, optional assigned readings will serve as inspiration, featuring authors such as Nicholson Baker, Teju Cole, Willa Cather, Virginia Woolf, and W.G. Sebald, among others.\nBy the end of the course, students will leave with a body of new writing, fresh observational tools, and a renewed awareness of how movement shapes creative practice.",

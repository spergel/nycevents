      "description": "“I opened a gallery of anonymous memories.”\n– Don Hertzfeldt, \nA World of Tomorrow\nAnonymous or known, memory serves us as a biological archive of moments in our mind and stored into bytes of data stored on a computer. This course offers a dedicated space to collect and organize a digital archive of your own. Work alongside others to preserve a physical or digital artwork, tell the story of an internet rabbit hole you find fascinating, or collect relics of your own virtual dreamscape. You will learn research-based methods in digital archiving, participate in daily journaling and documentation via photo/video/audio recordings, and engage in class discussions about previous works in digital preservation and community memory.\nParticipants will regularly engage in and be encouraged to collect, produce, and write about the work they are archiving outside of class, while keeping a daily journal. Alexa will check in online and facilitate reading discussions to freely engage or disengage in throughout the week. Class time will include lectures and discussions on methods of digital preservation and process documentation techniques, soft critique sessions of work-in-progress, and studio time to practice alongside one another.\nYou will learn both technical and non-technical skills in writing creatively about your process, photo and video documentation, digitally storing and organizing information, and 3D photogrammetry of physical objects, all correlating into a virtual exhibition space called \nNew Art City\n.\nThis class is for the casual diarist who wants to encapsulate their memory further through image and sound, for the artist wanting to challenge themselves in documenting their process, for the designer wishing to develop a portfolio piece with proper documentation, for the musician who wants to establish place and environment to further their work, for the 3D artist who wants to capture a dreamscape hidden with lore and digital relics, for the internet historian who wants to shine the light on obscure online communities, for the developer with an interest in old media emulation.",

      "description": "Since 2021, we’ve been offering installments of Intro to Coding for Designers to dozens of our peers who have left the course with projects that show their design practice in a whole new light. For the first time ever, Index is offering a version of Intro to Coding for students to take on their own schedule, at their own pace.\nLearn foundational skills in web development with HTML and CSS, while responding to creative prompts and immersing yourself in a feminist, counter-cultural history of the internet.\nIn 7 30–60 minute chapters along with a few creative tutorials called ‘experiments,’ you’ll learn new skills in programming and begin to use code as a creative medium. Each chapter, you’ll be guided by readings and prompted to participate in discussions in Discord about life on the internet. Play, pause, and return to course materials any time as you learn at the pace that’s right for you.\nThroughout the class, students will work on a personal web zine on a topic of their choice, leaving class with a completed, interactive, browser-based project. \nWhat sets this course apart from other coding courses is the lesson on content management systems (CMS) with Kirby. You will learn how to create a fully functional CMS to allow you to build sites for others to update the website without having to code. Perfect for team collaboration!\nGet access to resources like code snippets, readings, and references from within and beyond the Index community, students will learn foundational tools for self-publishing and archiving on the internet.",

Each session we’ll pick a platform, discuss what its algorithms might be hiding, and then divide up into teams — divers, researchers, excavators, and cartographers — and plunge the platform’s depths for signs of life. We’ll use what we find as materials to create new works, talk about what we learned, and return to our days with water between our toes.\nTogether, we’ll plunge into the deepest darkest corners of the internet on our lunch break. Since this is a highly collaborative team workshop, attendance is limited to the first 100 signups. (You may choose to attend as many or as few expeditions as you like.)",

      "description": "Have you been in your feelings lately?\nPeople today have been encouraged to confront and process their inner worlds more than any generation prior – all at a time when psychological danger feels high, and social ties are getting looser.\nIn Your Feelings? is an event series by Futures Friends NYC, dedicated to unpacking emotions against a backdrop of change, and exploring where they’re going. How has the algorithmic amplification of rage impacted our social fabric? What does fulfillment look like in the age of optimization? Why are people yearning for eras they’ve never experienced themselves?\nOur agenda is designed under the hypothesis that we can foster better, more hopeful futures by processing heavy emotions together, and with intent.\nOur first event is focused on Yearning. For each event, three speakers are invited to discuss an emotion, where they’re seeing it, and how it’s evolving – on a personal level or cultural level. Speakers will then convene for a panel discussion, followed by an interactive engagement that will carry us through to our next event.",

What possibilities can we reveal by seeing our own works from different vantage points?\nPart group critique, part writing workshop, part reflective residency, this workshop invites you to develop a creative archiving practice for your artist practice, diary entries, collection of writings, and more. Outputs will vary, but may look like:\nwebsite of archived writing entries\nphotography series of your collection of artifacts you have crafted yourself\ndrawings that are inspired by a collection of diary entries made into gifs\na monthly newsletter to your friends of your weekly grocery lists\nPlease come to class having read the supplied pre-reading (available after registration) about indexing, catalog theory, and artist archives.

Every session, every participant will make something — with goals of lowering our own barriers to entry, freeing ourselves from overthinking, and using group accountability to encourage each other to create for the sake of creating.\nEach participant will also launch a low-stakes, high-joy personal project to an audience while exploring questions like:\nWhat is a “launch?” What is a “project?” What is an “audience?” Who do we make things for? Who would we rather make things for?\nWhat inspires us as humans vs. as workers?\nWhat would we make if we didn’t overthink? How do we get out of our own way?\nHow do we personally and collectively find joyful creative flow?\nParticipants do not need to have a personal project in mind before signing up. Some examples of low-stakes, high-joy personal projects from previous Launch courses:\nA crocheted outfit for a kitten.\nA Spotify-wrapped-style mobile experience based on a year's worth of Fitbit sleep data.\nThe first in a seven-part dinner party series where guests eat and wear only one color.\nA zine about sex positivity inspired by a tweenage fascination with the Nars Orgasm collection.\nA weekly series of Hallmark movie haiku reviews.\nA Matisse-ification tool for redesigning iconic visual artifacts of the 21st century inspired by the print that is in seemingly every StreetEasy staging photo.\nA pop-up restaurant menu based on ingredients from the course’s collective pantry.\nA microblog of useless car facts.\nThis course is for you if:\nYou make things or would like to make things in any medium.\nYou ever feel stuck or like you’re not sure which (if any) personal projects to pursue.\nYou’re looking to inject more spontaneity, community, and intention into your creative practice.\nYou’re interested in exploring creative work outside of its commercial value.\nThis course is not for you if:\nYou are hoping it will help you seek VC funding or a spot on Shark Tank (although “an illustrated zine ranking episodes of Shark Tank based on how much an actual shark would enjoy them” would make an incredible Launch project!)",

Public environments like sidewalks, parks, and subway stations become places where memory, attention, and story intersect. These observations will become the foundation for meditative episodes, digressive accounts, and stream-of-consciousness vignettes that trace the interplay between outer world and inner life.\nSessions include three parts:\nTime spent in public space gathering material\nA focused in-class writing period with prompts\nOptional sharing and discussion.\nThis class is open to writers and artists of all levels who are curious about the relationship between attention, movement, and narrative.\nWe’ll draw inspiration from short, optional readings by writers such as Nicholson Baker, Teju Cole, Willa Cather, Virginia Woolf, and W.G. Sebald.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll leave with a body of new writing, sharpened observational tools, strategies for gathering material, and a renewed awareness of how the world around you can shape your creative practice.",

Can independent publishing offer you a respite in these trying times?\nThe answer to all of these questions is YES.\nJoin us for the second iteration of this course, where we will be examining the history and form of self-published zines while producing our own expressions of the art form. Over the course of 6 weeks, we will learn more about the revolutionary roots of independent publishing, and learn how to design and make physical zines.\nIf you’ve ever been curious about making a zine, or if you've experimented with the art form in the past but want to know more, this course is for you! The ideal candidate has experience using graphic design software such as Adobe InDesign, an open mind to making things with your hands, and a desire to explore the outer reaches of independent publishing.",

This method involves placing flowers and various natural materials on fabric, tightly rolling it into a bundle, and then steaming to release the dyes, resulting in beautiful, organic patterns.\nEach one will leave with their one-of-a-kind dyed piece, as well as the knowledge to replicate the process on their own and a greater understanding of the science behind the bundle dye technique.\nThis beginner-friendly workshop offers a creative, enriching way to learn a new sustainable technique, providing comprehensive instruction and all necessary supplies—from dyestuff to fabrics.

During each session, we will read aloud a chapter from \nAll About Love\n by bell hooks and give live reactions in the form of a round table discussion.\nThe beauty of collective reading is that all sessions are open and free flowing. If you missed a previous session, don’t fret — you can hop into any session without context. Collective reading requires less commitment than a traditional book club or reading circle. If you have a certain chapter you’d like to talk about with folks, then come to that session. No need to read ahead, just come with yourself and an open mind.\nWe will be starting with Chapter 1 in the first session so if you have time feel free to read the Preface and Introduction on your own. This event series requires that you, BYOT (bring your own text) whether that’s a hard copy, ebook, or pdf.\nLastly, we would like to thank our PALs for making this event series possible and completely free. To learn more about the impact of PALs, check out this page, \nhere\n.",

Then we’ll use that space to brainstorm and design a gift for a friend or loved one, and take what we’ve learned from the exercise and apply it to our everyday practice of making.",

Students with a strong interest in writing, photography, and archiving are encouraged to attend, although this should not prevent students of disparate disciplines from signing up.\nThrough group walks, lectures, readings, discussions, and artist visits we will survey the ways memory can be used as source material; how it can be documented, archived, accessed, and shaped to produce new bodies of work. Students will study a wide range of artwork, literature, music, film, oral histories, and archives which make distinctive use of memory.\nWe will suppliment our explorations with short excercises and assignments that utilize personal histories, journals, found material, online archives, and self-published publications. We will explore how we can effectively re-contextualize our own memories, construct new meaning, blur the lines between fact and fiction and develop a broader perspective of one’s lived experience and surroundings.",

      "description": "As designers, we’re constantly navigating cycles of feedback to develop creative ideas with resonance and impact. \nIn this course, each student will develop a production-ready design concept, learning hard and soft skills on how to give and action creative feedback. We’ll push ourselves and one another to consider new perspectives, influences, and resources while learning what makes a creative concept resonant and meaningful. \nAs you hone your project concept, you’ll learn critical communication skills, setting you on a path for fruitful creative growth within — and beyond — your career as a designer. \nCome with a freelance or personal design project you’re embarking on, or develop a concept for your own website. We’ll explore how to find a unique, fundamental truth in every design problem, and build it into an actionable and beautiful creative concept. \nWhether you’re a freelancer needing to get out of your own head, a member of a creative team looking for new sources of inspiration, or an independent designer looking to ground your personal projects with an audience, this 4-week workshop offers an opportunity for designers to develop a viable design idea, practice presenting concepts with precision, and push each other’s work in new directions. \nWhile no specific skill level is required, all participants should be practicing graphic designers with a working understanding of composition, typography, color theory, art direction, and standard project lifecycles.",

The proverbial guru and author have more in common than we might think.\nJoin us for early evening meditations led by Gideon, some of which will be more traditional exercises meant to anchor you in reality, some of which will be pieces he has written in this particular style for publications like Buffalo Zine, Office Magazine, Autre, and more.",

      "description": "Architect and philosopher Manuel DeLanda has claimed among a host of others that rivers, with their sorting behavior of sediments and critters, are something like ecological or watershed computers. This idea of rivers, rocks, and forests as computers has had a significant backing in scientific and architectural communities since the early days of computer science, yet what such a statement would mean for most of us is somewhat unclear and inconsistent. At its limit, this worldview considers the universe itself and everything contained within it as rudimentary computers; a philosophy known as \npancomputationalism\n which lurks near arguably all contemporary sensibilities of practice.\nThis 6-week course is dedicated to modeling a practical framework of natural computers to artists and designers. Working from simple mathematical formalisms to a survey of existing artists and architects, we’ll develop projects that deploy what Sejo Vega has called non-electronic digital systems that are in harmony with nature.\nWe’ll model this framework through an simple overview of introductory concepts from computer science. Covering \nAutomata\n, \nLanguages\n, \nMachines\n, we’ll learn to read and write super simple logical formulas and then workshop them using non-electronic materials and systems like haikus, vintage legos, a 1998 passenger van and its 8 cylinder engine, Chinese logograms, a dance routine, some coloring books, and a waterfall. The artists and designers whose works we’ll engage with include \nVega\n, \nJose Sanchez\n, \nGilles Retsin\n &\n Mollie Claypool\n, \nAndrea Zittel\n, \nAA Cavia\n, and the game studio \nAmanita Design\n.\nWhere DeLanda and others have provoked the philosophy of computation in natural systems \nas\n a design framework, this course will help us to think what this idea might actually mean formally beyond the armchair of thinking and into the fields of practice. Following a kind of Marxist ethics, if we want to understand the intelligence of a river, then we’ll have to learn the language that it speaks.\nStudents will be asked to develop and share work and are formally encouraged to join for an offsite class exhibition in partnership with \nArts, Letters, and Numbers\n early November where we will day trip to a series of waterfalls and taverns.",

      "description": "Designing Spaces for Humans is an exploration to empower people with architectural thinking. This mode of thinking can be applied to many other creative practices (product design, fashion, film, etc) and many who study architecture go on to great things outside the field. Ultimately, it’s a creative practice that is rooted in the human experience and a reflection of current culture and technology. How can we reimagine a future and influence human behaviours through space? \nHow can we make spaces more human?\nThis course is for absolute beginners to the craft of architecture. It will help demystify a scary and intimidating medium, providing examples and entry points that apply to everyday life. Architectural thinking can apply to many creative practices—since you’re thinking about spaces that humans occupy, you will shift your mind to think about the human scale and how it affects our private and public lives.\nThis is a live, virtual class. Zoom recordings will be provided for registered students.\nLearning Outcomes\nLearn 2D and 3D computer modeling with Rhinoceros\nDevelop an understanding of architectural thinking\nLearn and discuss preliminary architectural history\nExplore different representation techniques (Photoshop, Illustrator)\nBuild an architectural project (plans, sections, 3D renderings)\nLearn how to read architectural drawings\nLearn spatial vocabulary & create an architectural voice\nRequirements\nNo experience required.

      "description": "Over six weeks, we’ll read and discuss a series of texts that provide a framework for understanding and contextualizing the landscape around us. We’ll read texts from the 20th Century philosophy canon – Foucault’s “Utopian Body” and Deleuze’s “Nomadology: The War Machine,” for example – as well as more contemporary texts from influential thinkers and artists such as Hito Steyerl and Timothy Morton. Informed by these readings, you will be prompted to create a series of visual and/or audio projects aimed at exploring or challenging your ideas about utopias or “other spaces.”\nQuestions we’ll ask in this class include: What do we mean by utopia? What do our conceptions of utopia say about ourselves and our society? How do we incorporate theory into an art practice?\nBy taking this course, you’ll gain a better understanding of a range of philosophical texts, develop strategies for incorporating philosophical concepts into your own artistic practice, and maybe even plant the seeds of a new creative project.",

      "description": "Our second cohort of Artistic Alchemy is much more than a book club. It is a creative community to take respite and cocoon, to incubate your ideas and form your chrysalis, to transmute your creative desires and to take flight to your goals.\nIn addition to working through the book together, your instructor Ella will meet with you for individualized creative production sessions to help you conjure, set, and achieve your creative goals. Whether you’re a writer with writer’s block, a painter who dreams of playing the piano, or a project manager seeking a creative outlet other than beautifying your team’s Notion, this process is sure to alchemize artistic action.\nAt the foundation of our course, we will work through the cult classic, The Artist’s Way—a book that promises to empower you with confidence and cultivate essential habits to ignite your artistic spark. The book itself is a deeply introspective and personal journey that proves most effective when paired with a space for accountability and connection. Thus, for 13 weeks, we'll meet via Zoom (and one-on-one) to weave together its inspiring exercises and proven practices with Ella’s expertise in nurturing creative development. Through this process we'll discover more about ourselves and who we want to be, while also developing bonds and fostering new creative relationships.\nWhen and where the time-space continuum allows, we'll gather for meet-ups. Some of last year’s excursions included meditative birding in Prospect Park, a zine-making workshop at Pioneer Works, and numerous dinner parties across North and Central America. At the end of our joint experience you’ll have the option to contribute a piece of work to a editorial compilation that may take shape in the form of a physical or digital zine, we’ll vibe that out together. Check out last year’s digital zine \nhere\n. \nThe outcomes of this process are endless! Members of our last cohort achieved amazing accomplishments: they finished writing albums, changed career directions, bought their first apartments, reignited their passion for painting, relocated across the globe, authored books, embraced public speaking, quit their damn day jobs to start a gallery, and, most importantly, forged connections that up lift and inspire them to shine as their shiny artist selves in their daily lives.",

Led by local guides John and Oleh, we’ll spend the afternoon learning to cast, catch, and release wild trout as they swim the open waters of the Beaverkill River.\nIn the evening, we’ll enjoy the first flavors of spring with a meal of local food, good wine, and Rachael’s famous upstate pies. All dietary restrictions will be accommodated, just let us know so we can plan!\nRooms are available for single and double occupancy, with accommodations and all food and beverages for the weekend included. Transportation is \nnot\n included, but we’ll send pick-up options at the local bus station for those looking to arrive by public transportation. Let us know when you’re arriving, and we’ll be there to pick you up!\nIf you’re feeling the need to put your face in the sun, smell some dirt, and hear some birdsong, while connecting with new friends from the Index community, we hope you’ll join us!",

Additionally, we will learn the unique language of dreams as it appears in spiritual and psychoanalytical practice, and strengthen our abilities to consistently enter the dream world through guided exercises conducted in-class and at home. Through meditation, free-association, and journalling, participants will be asked to identify and map the landscapes, characters, and moods of our individual psyches in the safe space of our classroom and at-home coursework.\nParticipants will co-create a zine that catalogues our dreams, with the shared goal of building a living, creative archive of a collective subconscious of those who partake in the course. In doing so, our class will mirror the dream world itself: recognizable and communal, but creatively individualized. The final zine will be assembled and disseminated by Jillian.",

Could that waking be our end?\nIn \nBliss Montage\n, Ling Ma brings us eight wildly different tales of people making their way through the madness and reality of our collective delusions: love and loneliness, connection and possession, friendship, motherhood, the idea of home. A woman lives in a house with all her ex-boyfriends. A toxic friendship grows up around a drug that makes you invisible. An ancient ritual might heal you of anything—if you bury yourself alive.\nThese and other scenarios investigate the ways that the outlandish and the ordinary are shockingly, deceptively, heartbreakingly alike.\nThe reading will be done live within the group and we will have discussions unpacking each story after reading. No need to read ahead, just come with yourself and an open mind.",

And for those from afar, or for weeks you may be traveling, an asynchronous zoom will be setup. Regardless of where you are we’ll host an online portal to hold space for sharing and inspiration.\nAt the end of our joint experience you’ll have the option to contribute a piece of work to an editorial compilation that may take shape in the form of a physical or digital zine - we’ll vibe that out together.",

      "description": "3D Modeling for Print is a class in which participants will learn how to create their own virtual objects in Blender! Blender is a fun, free, open-source program that can be utilized for 3D modeling, video editing, illustration, animation, and more. The class will be led by \nBrendan Page\n, a projectionist and founder of the Risograph press \nEach and Every\n.\nIn the first class, we will work together to create one object, a vase with flowers, using the basic tools of Blender (sculpting, texturing, coloring, and lighting). In the second class, participants will use the skills they’ve gained to create their own unique objects from scratch. A photo-un realistic dog? Maybe not at this point. A lumpy dog-shaped object? Perfect. The stranger it looks on your computer the better it prints.\nOn the final day, Brendan will walk students through the process of making 4 color Risograph prints of the work made in class. All participants will receive a small booklet featuring these prints after this last session.",

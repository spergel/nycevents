Come join us for an introductory through-hole solderSoldering is one of the most important skills you'll need for working with electronics. Come join us for an introductory through-hole soldering workshop. Soldering enables you to create sturdy connections between electrical components. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to use a soldering iron safely and effectively, and get plenty of practice with both soldering and de-soldering techniques. We'll be soldering up some Game of Life kits - LED tiles that generate nifty animations. No previous experience is required, making this introductory workshop a great choice for anyone who's curious about getting started with hardware tinkering! All materials will be provided.\nOK, awesome, I want to join!\nPlease be ready to start at 1pm! We find that you will need this time to get through the whole class.

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Building your own gear doesn't have to be a solitary hobby anymore... has regular meetups to share recent DIY audio projects (speakers, amps, DACs, etc - anything home-audio related), as well as talks and demos on related topics and skills (how to solder, how digital crossovers work, fabrication techniques, digital room correction, etc).\nThis month we're going to talk about repairs, and cover the basics that anyone who's contracted this audio illness should know - we're talking weekend projects that don't need sophisticated equipment.(Things like refoaming speakers, cleaning scratchy volume pots, repairing cables, replacing capacitors, etc.)Do you have a brief demo you can share? Let us know at diyaudio@gowanusaudio.com and we'll add it to the list.\n(If history is any guide, at the end of the meetup some of us will want to keep talking about projects and we'll move to a bar nearby - join us!)\nWho should come?\nOpen to anyone interested in DIY home audio who wants to learn and make some new friends - all experience levels welcome. If you've ever wanted to build any audio gear, we're here for you. (We generally don't focus on production, live sound, musical instruments, or making music, although there certainly is some overlap.)\nNote from the organizer, Pete:\nI started diyaudio.nyc a couple years ago because I wanted to meet some like-minded folks near me - I knew they were out there. And they are! Thank you for being a part! Let's grow this group! These days, for me, it's all audio all the time - I work as a Buyer for The Music Room buying high end audio equipment, and also offer complete classes to build your own equipment as Gowanus Audio.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

This hands-on workshop introduces you to the powerful RayTK library, allowing you to explore RayMarching techniques without the need for GLSL. Designed for creative coders, visual artists, and interactive designers, this workshop will empower you to build complex visuals using a node-based approach in TouchDesigner.\nYou'll start with the fundamentals of RayMarching, discovering how math-based Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) redefine 3D rendering by eliminating traditional geometry. We’ll dive into RayTK, a versatile library of TouchDesigner components, and explore its unique ability to generate infinitely repeating patterns, fractals, reflections, and more—without writing a single line of code.\nBy the end of the workshop, you'll have a solid foundation in RayMarching, know how to design with RayTK nodes, and be able to incorporate animations, MIDI, and audio for interactive scenes. Whether you're creating dynamic patterns or multi-layered fractal landscapes, this workshop will leave you confident in pushing the boundaries of TouchDesigner’s node-based editor, opening new dimensions for your creative projects.\nNote: Prior TouchDesigner experience, and TouchDesigner loaded on your own laptop are required for this class.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

Just by owning a smartphone from the past decade, you already have access to an entire suite of high-quality hardware tools, including: HD camera, high fidelity microphone, precise accelerometer/gyroscope/compass, GPS, touchscreen, speaker and audio output port, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, and a built-in rechargeable battery, all within a sleek and compact enclosure. The equivalent components/materials used together with a microcontroller such as an Arduino or ESP32 could cost you up to $100, require additional programming/prototyping and custom fabrication and still not work as well! Not to mention, using repurposed smartphones is a fantastic way to reduce e-waste. You can purchase an \"old\" (3 years old) smartphone for $50 bucks and it'll do almost anything you need.You don't need to be a certified app developer to create custom software to run on your phone. You just need a web browser, (included on literally every smartphone) some familiarity with HTML/Javascript and a simple web server (code provided).This fast-paced, hands-on workshop will begin with some basic relevant networking terms/tools and then dive into a relatively simple starter example that will transform your mobile device into a wireless handheld controller. We'll learn how to stream data from any number of the hardware tools above from your phone directly into some software of your choice (TouchDesigner, Max/MSP, Ableton, Unity, Unreal, Arduino, etc.), and will save some time for experimentation and Q/A aftwards.Who is this for?\nThis class is suited for creative, curious and open-minded individuals who are comfortable with diving into new and unfamiliar tools and expanding their knowledge of what's possible. The examples covered in the workshop will be geared towards real-time multimedia performance but can absolutely be applied to any other medium/installation.\nWhat should I bring?Attendees should come with a mobile device or tablet and a computer with some creative software of your choice (TouchDesigner, Max/MSP or any OSC-enabled software recommended).To save time, come in with Node.js already installed from here: https://nodejs.org/en\nThe instructor:\nYonatan Rozin is a NY/NJ-based interactive technologist, web developer. As a relentlessly curious collaborator and prototyper, Yonatan's works often employ unconventional combinations of existing hardware and software tools. His work as the lead creative technologist for BodyMouth, a body motion-reactive speech instrument developed for transmedia playwright Kat Mustatea, was a finalist in the 2024 Guthman Musical Instrument Competition and the 2024 Lumen Prize in the “Interactive Immersive” category.Yonatan has helped create websites for organizations including NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program and the Harvestworks Media Arts Center, and is passionate about collaborating with creative individuals and organizations. He holds a Bachelor of Music Performance from the Peabody Conservatory and a Master of Professional Studies from NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, where he also completed a research residency and taught as an adjunct instructor.\n\n\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance.

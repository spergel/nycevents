Please \nregister on Eventbrite\n.\n\n\nAt Drawn Together, we provide prompts and materials for you to experiment and explore with your visual art-making practice, all without the pressure of having to do it well.\n\n\nBecause of this one-night partnership, we’ll also have access to Interference Archive’s materials, which we’ll be using as part of our inspiration.\n\n\nThe mission of Interference Archive is to explore the relationship between cultural production and social movements. This work manifests in an open stacks archival collection, publications, a study center, and public programs including exhibitions, workshops, talks, and screenings, all of which encourage critical and creative engagement with the rich history of social movements.\n\n\nCome for the art-making, stay for a collection of visual media related to the history of activism and social movements around the world!\n\n\nTiming:\n Doors at 7. Come early to save your seat! Games begin at 7:30.\n\n\nSupplies:\n Pencils and paper will be provided, though you’re encouraged to bring your own supplies if you’d like.",

Join us for this hands-on workshop facilitated by author and time capsule keeper Lisa Ko and inspired by her new novel \nMemory Piece\n. Participants will have access to Interference Archive’s materials for inspiration, and will build their own time capsules as an analog antidote to digital authoritarianism, incorporating writing prompts and creating a list of contents and a plan for storage and preservation.\n\n\nPlease bring a closeable container (a large envelope, shoebox, jar, gallon-sized bag, etc.) and at least one item you’d like to include in your time capsule, as well as any other supplies you might want to use (paper, markers, scissors, etc.). We’ll have limited supplies available as well.\n\n\nPlease RSVP \nhere\n.",

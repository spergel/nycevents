      "description": "Now as always we need cheap and accessible tools to take care of ourselves and each other. From Japanese American incarceration camps to Lincoln Detox and the NADA protocol, acupuncture has been a tool of resistance for regular people to reclaim their health.\n\n\nJoin us at Interference Archive on March 18th at 7pm for the next installment of the Education Working Group’s Skillshare Workshop series and to learn about a radical history of acupuncture in the Americas while looking at related materials from the Archive. We will also demonstrate and practice an acupressure protocol for stress reduction using ear seeds to stimulate pressure points in the ear (no needles required!). Materials will be provided but participants should bring their own tweezers if possible.",

This is a wonderful opportunity to connect with others, learn about important work happening in our community, and gather materials to show support and solidarity.\n\n\nThe event is free and open to everyone!\n All materials created will be available at no cost. While not required, donations are warmly welcomed to help fund future Propaganda Parties (either in person or through the support link below).\n\n\n\n\nSupport our materials cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBring your own canvas!\n We’ll have some t-shirts available, but we encourage you to bring your own t-shirts and tote bags to print on.\n\n\nWho is invited? \nEveryone! Come with friends or on your own to meet new people. Representatives from organizations are welcome to bring flyers or postcards to share your work and help others connect with your cause. \n\n\nOur Organizers: \nThe \nGender-expansive Families Propaganda Party\n is organized by \nParents of Gender Expansive Kids (POGEK) at PS39 together\n with \nInterference Archive,\n and additional support from \nPS39’s Parent Association\n, \nTrans formative Schools\n, \nTextile Art Center\n, & \nBooklyn, Inc\n.\n\n\nWhat is a propaganda party?\n It’s a gathering where organizations, activists, artists, and community members  come together to create and share t-shirts, posters, buttons and other materials while connecting with one another in a supportive environment. \n\n\nWhy “propaganda”? \n“Propaganda,” shares roots with  “propagate,” and refers to information, ideas, or images shared in support of a cause.  While this word has taken on negative connotations in modern times, we’re reclaiming it!  Our daily lives are saturated with supposedly “neutral” materials that implicitly support existing power structures. We use the word “propaganda” because this work is not neutral—we’re proudly supporting our gender-expansive community.",

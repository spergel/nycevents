Preference will be given to aci-d club members!​Let’s marvel at the oppressive beauty of brutalist buildings, from iconic landmarks to hidden gems. Our journey begins in Tribeca, where we’ll stroll along the west side, ending at Washington Square Park. Along the way, we’ll explore architectural wonders such as the AT&T Long Lines Building and the Salt Shed.​During our tour, we’ll delve into the history of these buildings, discussing the visionary architects behind their design, their original purposes, and how they are utilized today. We’ll also explore the challenges and triumphs faced during their construction, adding depth to our understanding of these monumental structures.​This walking tour is at street level, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring along a bottle of water!Note: if you're able, paying $20 helps sustain aci-d club and makes future events possible—we’d really appreciate your support!_Liza Paganois a lifelong New Yorker and a curious Creative Director with a love for all things design. She has a fondness for wabi-sabi philosophy, brutalist architecture, and a well-worn river stone. In her spare time, you’ll find her riding her bike all over NYC, always in search of that one special block she’s never seen before—and she always finds it.",

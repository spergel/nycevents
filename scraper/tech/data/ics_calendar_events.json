If you aren't familiar with either, I'd recommend reading up a little beforehand. Here are some links to get you started:dynamicland.org,Geokit,Dynamicland experiments,folk.computer.Tickets are limited, and preference will be given to people who people who have shown up to past aci-d club hangs or events, though we will have some slots open for new faces!​—​Folk Computeris a research & art project, led byOmar RizwanandAndrés Cuervo, centered around designing new physical computing interfaces.Folk Computer is developing a new open-source 'physical computing' system, where you operate the computer by moving physical objects around (instead of laptop/phone/mouse/keyboard/touchscreen).

      "description": "​Update:We’re sold out! We’ll likely do a second tour in April or May. Follow ourInstagramor subscribe to our luma calendar to hear about the announcement!​——​Join us for a visit to the Lubalin Archives at The Cooper Union.The Lubalin Center preserves the work of Herb Lubalin and other designers through an archive that includes drawings, type specimens, posters, logos, and advertising materials. Lubalin is a goated American Graphic Designer and this growing archive contain works not only by him but also Paul Rand, Milton Glaser, Massimo Vignelli, and many others.​The archive isn’t digitized so you literally won’t be able to find its stuff on are.na, Pinterest, google images etc. We’re moving beyond aesthetics and engaging with materiality and context, folks! As someone who has visited the archives, I’d say it contains some of the best design references in the country.​We’re getting a hands-on presentation of a selection of material which lasts about an hour and a half. It's a closer look at some of the objects in the collection, the stories behind them, and what they can teach us about making work today. The emphasis is on ways we can make active use of design history as contemporary practitioners. The curators will use physical examples from the collection to construct specific case studies of ways we can look at objects to inform today's design decisions.​The Center usually doesn’t host groups past 3 PM, but they’ve graciously agreed to keep the archive open for us until 6 PM on Friday, allowing for a 4 PM start. You may need to leave work a little early, but it’s a Friday and well worth it.",

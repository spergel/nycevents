Put your networking GPS on \"adventure mode\" & merge onto something completely different!\r  FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS: WE'RE TAKING THE ROAD LESS VENTURE-D \r Daring Ventures invites you to ditch the Silicon Valley traffic jam & join us for a cross-country expedition to the beating heart of America's overlooked tech hubs. No compass necessary-just bring your appetite for disruption & authentic BBQ!\r WHY STAY IN YOUR LANE when you can swerve into the fast-growing tech scenes beyond the coasts?\r Our all-star lineup of non-coastal VCs will be your tour guides through the technological landmarks you've been missing:\r Columbus, OH - Where innovation doesn't require an ocean view\r Milwaukee, WI - Brewing up startups that'll make you say \"cheese!\"\r Atlanta, GA - Where startups rise faster than the summer heat\r Austin, TX - Where your funding round comes with a side of queso\r PANELISTS:\r Christy Johnson (Fireroad Ventures)\r Jennifer Abele (VC 414)\r William Leonard (Valor Ventures)\r Anish Zut (Drive Capital)\r FUEL UP with a mouthwatering spread of authentic regional delicacies that'll make your typical catered NYC event seem like a sad highway rest stop vending machine.\r WARNING: Attending other Tech Week events after ours may cause severe withdrawal symptoms. Side effects include constantly mentioning \"this amazing founder from Wisconsin\" & unconsciously calculating how your funding would stretch 3x further in Kansas City.\r THE SCENIC ROUTE IS THE ONLY ROUTE: In one night, you'll meet more genuine innovators than in a week of standard NYC elevator pitches. We promise fewer PowerPoints & more powerful connections.\r DRESS CODE: Highway chic (coastal elite outfits will be politely tolerated)\r Pack light, but bring plenty of business cards-this is one roadtrip where you'll actually want to pick up hitchhikers.\r RSVP before we leave you in the dust!\r SHOUT OUT TO OUR ROADTRIP COMPANIONS\r Rova Partners\r Startups often face fragmented financial systems, limited visibility, & the urgent need to become investor-ready.

By connecting finance & operations, we help founders gain financial visibility, improve decision-making, & build a foundation for sustainable growth.\r From early growth through major transactions, we bring precision & structure to every stage of the journey.\r   Offit Kurman\r Offit Kurman is a full-service Am Law 200 firm with more than 280 attorneys providing comprehensive legal counsel across 30+ practice areas.\r Since its founding in 1987, the firm has served dynamic businesses, individuals, & families-helping them maximize business value & protect personal wealth through innovative, entrepreneurial legal solutions.\r The firm is distinguished by the quality, breadth & global reach of its legal services & a unique operational structure that encourages a culture of collaboration.

Put your networking GPS on \"adventure mode\" & merge onto something completely different!\r  FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS: WE'RE TAKING THE ROAD LESS VENTURE-D \r Daring Ventures invites you to ditch the Silicon Valley traffic jam & join us for a cross-country expedition to the beating heart of America's overlooked tech hubs. No compass necessary-just bring your appetite for disruption & authentic BBQ!\r WHY STAY IN YOUR LANE when you can swerve into the fast-growing tech scenes beyond the coasts?\r Our all-star lineup of non-coastal VCs will be your tour guides through the technological landmarks you've been missing:\r Columbus, OH - Where innovation doesn't require an ocean view\r Milwaukee, WI - Brewing up startups that'll make you say \"cheese!\"\r Atlanta, GA - Where startups rise faster than the summer heat\r Austin, TX - Where your funding round comes with a side of queso\r PANELISTS:\r Christy Johnson (Fireroad Ventures)\r Jennifer Abele (VC 414)\r William Leonard (Valor Ventures)\r Anish Zut (Drive Capital)\r FUEL UP with a mouthwatering spread of authentic regional delicacies that'll make your typical catered NYC event seem like a sad highway rest stop vending machine.\r WARNING: Attending other Tech Week events after ours may cause severe withdrawal symptoms. Side effects include constantly mentioning \"this amazing founder from Wisconsin\" & unconsciously calculating how your funding would stretch 3x further in Kansas City.\r THE SCENIC ROUTE IS THE ONLY ROUTE: In one night, you'll meet more genuine innovators than in a week of standard NYC elevator pitches. We promise fewer PowerPoints & more powerful connections.\r DRESS CODE: Highway chic (coastal elite outfits will be politely tolerated)\r Pack light, but bring plenty of business cards-this is one roadtrip where you'll actually want to pick up hitchhikers.\r RSVP before we leave you in the dust!\r SHOUT OUT TO OUR ROADTRIP COMPANIONS\r Rova Partners\r Startups often face fragmented financial systems, limited visibility, & the urgent need to become investor-ready.

At AWS, we believe that startups & small businesses are not just key drivers of economic growth-they embody the spirit of American exceptionalism. Your insights, challenges, & experiences should play a defining role in shaping the policies that will determine the future of innovation in the U.S. & beyond.

It’s a safe and conscious space focused on being raw and vulnerable with whatever stage of creation people are at instead of focused on presenting a finished and polished project. Our larger showcases like this one serve as a space to share more polished projects, celebrate each other's work, and give our artists an opportunity to share their art with a wider audience.</p><h2>​<strong>Price and Accessibility commitment</strong></h2><p>​We want all our events to be accessible to everyone regardless of background or financial status. The pricing shown here is just to help us break even with costs of hosting the event and we don't make any profit off of these. If you have difficulties paying for the event, reach out to us <strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/workinprogressnyc/\" target=\"_blank\">@workinprogressnyc</a></strong> and we can arrange entry passes for you.</p>",

      "description": "RSVP https://www.eventbrite.com/e/beginner-crochet-class-flower-making-masks-on-tickets-1373594150079\n\nLearn the basics of crochet, by making two kinds of flowers, and leave with your own handmade earrings or key chain. All materials included.This is a masks required class. Please stay home if you are sick to prioritize the needs of the our immune compromised community.\n\nThe class:\nI will teach you how to crochet at a beginner level in general along with the techniques you will need to create two different flowers - a daisy and a forget-me-not! Once you are done with both, we will move on to adding metals and using supplies to either make a keychain or make a second copy and a pair of earrings!Before starting the flowers, you will choose whether you want to make earrings or a chain or keychain with your flower, and based on that, I'll help you choose a good hook size to use for your design. If you want to bring your own hooks to use, that's great too. We will be using green, yellow, white, and blue yarn that we will provide and your ticket purchase will include.\nI'm going to go step by step and will be happy to correct your hands, hook, or yarn techniques in person almost like a yoga instructor as I teach you the fundamentals. We will go through how to chain, single crochet, double crochet, slip stitch, weave in ends, and how I use the techniques for my crochet earring business where I sell similar products! Once we practice and go through these fundamentals, I'll apply the techniques for the flower with you following the pattern.I'll be showing you and walking through what the instructions mean and how it looks in real time! I'll teach you how to finish both flowers along with how to weave in the ends of the yarn like I do for my own earrings. Then we will select which metals you need from the Resistor's supplies and I'll help you use pliers to attach the metals to the flowers and the keychain circle or earring hooks. If you want to make another copy of one of the earrings to have a matching pair, there will also be time for that if you want to stay longer with me to help you through it a second time.\n\nWho is this class for:\nThis class is good for someone who has never crocheted before, someone starting out, a beginner, or someone with a little experience who wants to learn to make the flowers and get some spring accessories out of a refresher class, or someone who is more experienced than that but still would benefit from a class on how to crochet some flowers and make earrings or a keychain out of them.\nPlease reach out for a pay-what-you-can/free ticket if you are unable to purchase a ticket due to a financial barrier. We will have a few need-based spots available if you email classes@nycresistor.comThe Instructor:I have been crocheting for many years now, and I am now a small business seller of crochet earrings- on Etsy and on display @ theNonbinarianBike bookstore. I have made hundreds of crochet flowers and designed some of my own for various projects, and love it dearly.Crocheting has been so much better than I could have guessed for my creative self. It got me through grad school and an unpaid internship, and so many trainings without losing my mind. It is one of my favorite ways to stim as a Neurodivergent while working towards a project. I have a background in mental health and a lot of experience teaching/explaining things/webinar presenting/etc., and I love learning and helping folks gain access to creative therapeutic resources like crafting and crochet.\nPlease sign up early, as we need 5 students enrolled to run the class.\nWe are a proactively inclusive space, and prioritize creating opportunities for the whole community to engage with our events, across all identities of race, creed, ethnicity, age, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical appearance, and ability; please read our Code of Conduct to familiarize yourself with our community's values before attending. We are also an 18+ space, and accessibility information can be found here.\n",

It was terrible, but at least it wasn't owned by a dude who likes making \"roman salutes.\" After you divest from your SpaceX stock and sell your Tesla, come on down to NYC Resistor, where we'll show you how to ditch X but keep a personal copy of your favorite posts using Cyd.\nBefore the workshop: Make sure you can log on to X on your laptop (not your phone, your laptop) and once logged in, request an archive of your tweets using these instructions: https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-x-archive. Please do this step at least a week before the workshop, as it may take X a few to several days to process the archive request.BONUS: We'll also help you sign up for Mastodon, an X alternative, if you want.\nThis event is donate what-you-wish.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance.

      "description": "​Genome editing tools allow the introduction of precise changes in the DNA. For this ability, they became indispensable for basic biological research and hold great promise for future therapeutic applications. The same technologies are being utilized also in early human embryos for better understanding of key developmental regulators and DNA repair mechanisms. In the future, precise correction of specific genes might enable curing devastating diseases early in the development or decreasing the risks of certain diseases. Although continuous research is needed before such an intervention becomes safe, the first gene-edited babies were already born. This talk aims to contribute to the debate about human germline gene editing by putting it into a broader context of human biology, discussing the benefits, current limitations, and possible future alternatives leading to the prevention of genetic diseases.Stepan Jerabek is a postdoctoral research scientist in the Pediatrics Department at Columbia University. He is also an associate scientist at IOCB Prague, an institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Stepan’s interest in early development and genome stability brought him to the Egli laboratory, where he uses genome editing tools to study DNA repair in human preimplantation embryos. In 2024, Stepan was the recipient of the Druckenmiller Fellowship Award from the New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute. Stepan completed his doctoral training at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Germany and was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, working in the lab of genetics pioneer George Church.🐦Stay Connected about Future Events:Twitter:@descinyc_Instagram:@descinyc​PS: Apply to be a member of the DeSci NYC group chat:https://forms.gle/AmUtotmCgWgGxWDp6",

In this class you'll learn everything you need.Harness the power of an Epilog 60 Watt Laser! In this class you'll learn everything you need to know to make the ideas in your head become a reality with a laser.\nIn this three hour class, you will learn:\nHow to set up a file for cutting on the laser cutter in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.Laser cutter safety including materials testing.Laser cutter operation including configuration, cuts and raster etching in common materials like wood, acrylic, cardboard and others.At the end of class, you will go home with:\nOne laser cut project, either the class default or a simple one of your own design (see below for details)Resistor Laser Certification, enabling you to use our laser on Craft Nights.Please bring the following to class:\nA laptop with either Inkscape (free: download here: https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.2.1/) or Adobe Illustrator installed.\nA USB jump drive\nThe following items are optional if you'd like to try cutting a simple custom design. If your file ends up being too complicated, we may have you do the class default project first, just to learn the laser in the time allotted - but we'll definitely help you with your more complex cut at a free Craft Night in future!\nAn SVG vector file of a simple shape you'd like to cut for your first cut.A piece of 1/8 inch or thinner wood, acrylic or cardboard you'd like to cut. If you can't bring your own material, small pieces will be made available, or larger pieces for purchase on site.Please be on time for the start of class! If you're late you will miss your slot.\nThis class will be taught by NYC Resistor member Katie. As with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 72 hours in advance.

We'll show you how to archive your tweets with Cyd, then delete your content from Elon's website.Remember Twitter, aka the Hellsite? It was terrible, but at least it wasn't owned by a dude who likes making \"roman salutes.\" After you divest from your SpaceX stock and sell your Tesla, come on down to NYC Resistor, where we'll show you how to ditch X but keep a personal copy of your favorite posts using Cyd.\nBefore the workshop: Make sure you can log on to X on your laptop (not your phone, your laptop) and once logged in, request an archive of your tweets using these instructions: https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-x-archive. Please do this step at least a week before the workshop, as it may take X a few to several days to process the archive request.BONUS: We'll also help you sign up for Mastodon, an X alternative, if you want.\nThis event is donate what-you-wish.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

Come join us for an introductory through-hole solderSoldering is one of the most important skills you'll need for working with electronics. Come join us for an introductory through-hole soldering workshop. Soldering enables you to create sturdy connections between electrical components. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to use a soldering iron safely and effectively, and get plenty of practice with both soldering and de-soldering techniques. We'll be soldering up some Game of Life kits - LED tiles that generate nifty animations. No previous experience is required, making this introductory workshop a great choice for anyone who's curious about getting started with hardware tinkering! All materials will be provided.\nOK, awesome, I want to join!\nPlease be ready to start at 1pm! We find that you will need this time to get through the whole class. Our classes tend to sell out about a week in advance so if you're interested, you may want to sign up early.\nThis class will be taught by Resistor member Raphael.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/. Please note that refunds must be requested 72 hours in advance.

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

      "description": "​Genome editing tools allow the introduction of precise changes in the DNA. For this ability, they became indispensable for basic biological research and hold great promise for future therapeutic applications. The same technologies are being utilized also in early human embryos for better understanding of key developmental regulators and DNA repair mechanisms. In the future, precise correction of specific genes might enable curing devastating diseases early in the development or decreasing the risks of certain diseases. Although continuous research is needed before such an intervention becomes safe, the first gene-edited babies were already born. This talk aims to contribute to the debate about human germline gene editing by putting it into a broader context of human biology, discussing the benefits, current limitations, and possible future alternatives leading to the prevention of genetic diseases.Stepan Jerabek is a postdoctoral research scientist in the Pediatrics Department at Columbia University. He is also an associate scientist at IOCB Prague, an institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Stepan’s interest in early development and genome stability brought him to the Egli laboratory, where he uses genome editing tools to study DNA repair in human preimplantation embryos. In 2024, Stepan was the recipient of the Druckenmiller Fellowship Award from the New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute. Stepan completed his doctoral training at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Germany and was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, working in the lab of genetics pioneer George Church.🐦Stay Connected about Future Events:Twitter:@descinyc_Instagram:@descinyc​PS: Apply to be a member of the DeSci NYC group chat:https://forms.gle/AmUtotmCgWgGxWDp6",

Participants will have access to Interference Archive’s materials for inspiration, and will build their own time capsules as an analog antidote to digital authoritarianism, incorporating writing prompts and creating a list of contents and a plan for storage and preservation.\n\n\nPlease bring a closeable container (a large envelope, shoebox, jar, gallon-sized bag, etc.) and at least one item you’d like to include in your time capsule, as well as any other supplies you might want to use (paper, markers, scissors, etc.). We’ll have limited supplies available as well.\n\n\nPlease RSVP \nhere\n.",

Representatives from organizations are welcome to bring flyers or postcards to share your work and help others connect with your cause. \n\n\nOur Organizers: \nThe \nGender-expansive Families Propaganda Party\n is organized by \nParents of Gender Expansive Kids (POGEK) at PS39 together\n with \nInterference Archive,\n and additional support from \nPS39’s Parent Association\n, \nTrans formative Schools\n, \nTextile Art Center\n, & \nBooklyn, Inc\n.\n\n\nWhat is a propaganda party?\n It’s a gathering where organizations, activists, artists, and community members  come together to create and share t-shirts, posters, buttons and other materials while connecting with one another in a supportive environment. \n\n\nWhy “propaganda”? \n“Propaganda,” shares roots with  “propagate,” and refers to information, ideas, or images shared in support of a cause.  While this word has taken on negative connotations in modern times, we’re reclaiming it!  Our daily lives are saturated with supposedly “neutral” materials that implicitly support existing power structures. We use the word “propaganda” because this work is not neutral—we’re proudly supporting our gender-expansive community.",

Building your own gear doesn't have to be a solitary hobby anymore... has regular meetups to share recent DIY audio projects (speakers, amps, DACs, etc - anything home-audio related), as well as talks and demos on related topics and skills (how to solder, how digital crossovers work, fabrication techniques, digital room correction, etc).\nThis month we're going to talk about repairs, and cover the basics that anyone who's contracted this audio illness should know - we're talking weekend projects that don't need sophisticated equipment.(Things like refoaming speakers, cleaning scratchy volume pots, repairing cables, replacing capacitors, etc.)Do you have a brief demo you can share? Let us know at diyaudio@gowanusaudio.com and we'll add it to the list.\n(If history is any guide, at the end of the meetup some of us will want to keep talking about projects and we'll move to a bar nearby - join us!)\nWho should come?\nOpen to anyone interested in DIY home audio who wants to learn and make some new friends - all experience levels welcome. If you've ever wanted to build any audio gear, we're here for you. (We generally don't focus on production, live sound, musical instruments, or making music, although there certainly is some overlap.)\nNote from the organizer, Pete:\nI started diyaudio.nyc a couple years ago because I wanted to meet some like-minded folks near me - I knew they were out there. And they are! Thank you for being a part! Let's grow this group! These days, for me, it's all audio all the time - I work as a Buyer for The Music Room buying high end audio equipment, and also offer complete classes to build your own equipment as Gowanus Audio.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

This hands-on workshop introduces you to the powerful RayTK library, allowing you to explore RayMarching techniques without the need for GLSL. Designed for creative coders, visual artists, and interactive designers, this workshop will empower you to build complex visuals using a node-based approach in TouchDesigner.\nYou'll start with the fundamentals of RayMarching, discovering how math-based Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) redefine 3D rendering by eliminating traditional geometry. We’ll dive into RayTK, a versatile library of TouchDesigner components, and explore its unique ability to generate infinitely repeating patterns, fractals, reflections, and more—without writing a single line of code.\nBy the end of the workshop, you'll have a solid foundation in RayMarching, know how to design with RayTK nodes, and be able to incorporate animations, MIDI, and audio for interactive scenes. Whether you're creating dynamic patterns or multi-layered fractal landscapes, this workshop will leave you confident in pushing the boundaries of TouchDesigner’s node-based editor, opening new dimensions for your creative projects.\nNote: Prior TouchDesigner experience, and TouchDesigner loaded on your own laptop are required for this class.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

Just by owning a smartphone from the past decade, you already have access to an entire suite of high-quality hardware tools, including: HD camera, high fidelity microphone, precise accelerometer/gyroscope/compass, GPS, touchscreen, speaker and audio output port, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, and a built-in rechargeable battery, all within a sleek and compact enclosure. The equivalent components/materials used together with a microcontroller such as an Arduino or ESP32 could cost you up to $100, require additional programming/prototyping and custom fabrication and still not work as well! Not to mention, using repurposed smartphones is a fantastic way to reduce e-waste. You can purchase an \"old\" (3 years old) smartphone for $50 bucks and it'll do almost anything you need.You don't need to be a certified app developer to create custom software to run on your phone. You just need a web browser, (included on literally every smartphone) some familiarity with HTML/Javascript and a simple web server (code provided).This fast-paced, hands-on workshop will begin with some basic relevant networking terms/tools and then dive into a relatively simple starter example that will transform your mobile device into a wireless handheld controller. We'll learn how to stream data from any number of the hardware tools above from your phone directly into some software of your choice (TouchDesigner, Max/MSP, Ableton, Unity, Unreal, Arduino, etc.), and will save some time for experimentation and Q/A aftwards.Who is this for?\nThis class is suited for creative, curious and open-minded individuals who are comfortable with diving into new and unfamiliar tools and expanding their knowledge of what's possible. The examples covered in the workshop will be geared towards real-time multimedia performance but can absolutely be applied to any other medium/installation.\nWhat should I bring?Attendees should come with a mobile device or tablet and a computer with some creative software of your choice (TouchDesigner, Max/MSP or any OSC-enabled software recommended).To save time, come in with Node.js already installed from here: https://nodejs.org/en\nThe instructor:\nYonatan Rozin is a NY/NJ-based interactive technologist, web developer. As a relentlessly curious collaborator and prototyper, Yonatan's works often employ unconventional combinations of existing hardware and software tools. His work as the lead creative technologist for BodyMouth, a body motion-reactive speech instrument developed for transmedia playwright Kat Mustatea, was a finalist in the 2024 Guthman Musical Instrument Competition and the 2024 Lumen Prize in the “Interactive Immersive” category.Yonatan has helped create websites for organizations including NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program and the Harvestworks Media Arts Center, and is passionate about collaborating with creative individuals and organizations. He holds a Bachelor of Music Performance from the Peabody Conservatory and a Master of Professional Studies from NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, where he also completed a research residency and taught as an adjunct instructor.\n\n\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance.

Additionally, we will learn the unique language of dreams as it appears in spiritual and psychoanalytical practice, and strengthen our abilities to consistently enter the dream world through guided exercises conducted in-class and at home. Through meditation, free-association, and journalling, participants will be asked to identify and map the landscapes, characters, and moods of our individual psyches in the safe space of our classroom and at-home coursework.\nParticipants will co-create a zine that catalogues our dreams, with the shared goal of building a living, creative archive of a collective subconscious of those who partake in the course. In doing so, our class will mirror the dream world itself: recognizable and communal, but creatively individualized. The final zine will be assembled and disseminated by Jillian.",

      "description": "“I opened a gallery of anonymous memories.”\n– Don Hertzfeldt, \nA World of Tomorrow\nAnonymous or known, memory serves us as a biological archive of moments in our mind and stored into bytes of data stored on a computer. This course offers a dedicated space to collect and organize a digital archive of your own. Work alongside others to preserve a physical or digital artwork, tell the story of an internet rabbit hole you find fascinating, or collect relics of your own virtual dreamscape. You will learn research-based methods in digital archiving, participate in daily journaling and documentation via photo/video/audio recordings, and engage in class discussions about previous works in digital preservation and community memory.\nParticipants will regularly engage in and be encouraged to collect, produce, and write about the work they are archiving outside of class, while keeping a daily journal. Alexa will check in online and facilitate reading discussions to freely engage or disengage in throughout the week. Class time will include lectures and discussions on methods of digital preservation and process documentation techniques, soft critique sessions of work-in-progress, and studio time to practice alongside one another.\nYou will learn both technical and non-technical skills in writing creatively about your process, photo and video documentation, digitally storing and organizing information, and 3D photogrammetry of physical objects, all correlating into a virtual exhibition space called \nNew Art City\n.\nThis class is for the casual diarist who wants to encapsulate their memory further through image and sound, for the artist wanting to challenge themselves in documenting their process, for the designer wishing to develop a portfolio piece with proper documentation, for the musician who wants to establish place and environment to further their work, for the 3D artist who wants to capture a dreamscape hidden with lore and digital relics, for the internet historian who wants to shine the light on obscure online communities, for the developer with an interest in old media emulation.",

By the end of the session, you will understand the importance of indigenous seed sovereignty and preserving local soil health.

We’ll read texts from the 20th Century philosophy canon – Foucault’s “Utopian Body” and Deleuze’s “Nomadology: The War Machine,” for example – as well as more contemporary texts from influential thinkers and artists such as Hito Steyerl and Timothy Morton. Informed by these readings, you will be prompted to create a series of visual and/or audio projects aimed at exploring or challenging your ideas about utopias or “other spaces.”\nQuestions we’ll ask in this class include: What do we mean by utopia? What do our conceptions of utopia say about ourselves and our society? How do we incorporate theory into an art practice?\nBy taking this course, you’ll gain a better understanding of a range of philosophical texts, develop strategies for incorporating philosophical concepts into your own artistic practice, and maybe even plant the seeds of a new creative project.",

      "description": "Designing Spaces for Humans is an exploration to empower people with architectural thinking. This mode of thinking can be applied to many other creative practices (product design, fashion, film, etc) and many who study architecture go on to great things outside the field. Ultimately, it’s a creative practice that is rooted in the human experience and a reflection of current culture and technology. How can we reimagine a future and influence human behaviours through space? \nHow can we make spaces more human?\nThis course is for absolute beginners to the craft of architecture. It will help demystify a scary and intimidating medium, providing examples and entry points that apply to everyday life. Architectural thinking can apply to many creative practices—since you’re thinking about spaces that humans occupy, you will shift your mind to think about the human scale and how it affects our private and public lives.\nThis is a live, virtual class. Zoom recordings will be provided for registered students.\nLearning Outcomes\nLearn 2D and 3D computer modeling with Rhinoceros\nDevelop an understanding of architectural thinking\nLearn and discuss preliminary architectural history\nExplore different representation techniques (Photoshop, Illustrator)\nBuild an architectural project (plans, sections, 3D renderings)\nLearn how to read architectural drawings\nLearn spatial vocabulary & create an architectural voice\nRequirements\nNo experience required.

Led by local guides John and Oleh, we’ll spend the afternoon learning to cast, catch, and release wild trout as they swim the open waters of the Beaverkill River.\nIn the evening, we’ll enjoy the first flavors of spring with a meal of local food, good wine, and Rachael’s famous upstate pies. All dietary restrictions will be accommodated, just let us know so we can plan!\nRooms are available for single and double occupancy, with accommodations and all food and beverages for the weekend included. Transportation is \nnot\n included, but we’ll send pick-up options at the local bus station for those looking to arrive by public transportation. Let us know when you’re arriving, and we’ll be there to pick you up!\nIf you’re feeling the need to put your face in the sun, smell some dirt, and hear some birdsong, while connecting with new friends from the Index community, we hope you’ll join us!",

      "description": "What happens when fantasy tears the screen of the everyday to wake us up? Could that waking be our end?\nIn \nBliss Montage\n, Ling Ma brings us eight wildly different tales of people making their way through the madness and reality of our collective delusions: love and loneliness, connection and possession, friendship, motherhood, the idea of home. A woman lives in a house with all her ex-boyfriends. A toxic friendship grows up around a drug that makes you invisible. An ancient ritual might heal you of anything—if you bury yourself alive.\nThese and other scenarios investigate the ways that the outlandish and the ordinary are shockingly, deceptively, heartbreakingly alike.\nThe reading will be done live within the group and we will have discussions unpacking each story after reading. No need to read ahead, just come with yourself and an open mind.",

      "description": "Architect and philosopher Manuel DeLanda has claimed among a host of others that rivers, with their sorting behavior of sediments and critters, are something like ecological or watershed computers. This idea of rivers, rocks, and forests as computers has had a significant backing in scientific and architectural communities since the early days of computer science, yet what such a statement would mean for most of us is somewhat unclear and inconsistent. At its limit, this worldview considers the universe itself and everything contained within it as rudimentary computers; a philosophy known as \npancomputationalism\n which lurks near arguably all contemporary sensibilities of practice.\nThis 6-week course is dedicated to modeling a practical framework of natural computers to artists and designers. Working from simple mathematical formalisms to a survey of existing artists and architects, we’ll develop projects that deploy what Sejo Vega has called non-electronic digital systems that are in harmony with nature.\nWe’ll model this framework through an simple overview of introductory concepts from computer science. Covering \nAutomata\n, \nLanguages\n, \nMachines\n, we’ll learn to read and write super simple logical formulas and then workshop them using non-electronic materials and systems like haikus, vintage legos, a 1998 passenger van and its 8 cylinder engine, Chinese logograms, a dance routine, some coloring books, and a waterfall. The artists and designers whose works we’ll engage with include \nVega\n, \nJose Sanchez\n, \nGilles Retsin\n &\n Mollie Claypool\n, \nAndrea Zittel\n, \nAA Cavia\n, and the game studio \nAmanita Design\n.\nWhere DeLanda and others have provoked the philosophy of computation in natural systems \nas\n a design framework, this course will help us to think what this idea might actually mean formally beyond the armchair of thinking and into the fields of practice. Following a kind of Marxist ethics, if we want to understand the intelligence of a river, then we’ll have to learn the language that it speaks.\nStudents will be asked to develop and share work and are formally encouraged to join for an offsite class exhibition in partnership with \nArts, Letters, and Numbers\n early November where we will day trip to a series of waterfalls and taverns.",

Can independent publishing offer you a respite in these trying times?\nThe answer to all of these questions is YES.\nJoin us for the third iteration of Making and Breaking the Zine, where we will be examining the history and form of self-published zines while producing our own expressions of the art form. Over the course of 7 weeks, we will learn more about the revolutionary roots of independent publishing, and learn how to design and make physical zines.\nIf you’ve ever been curious about making a zine, or if you’ve experimented with the art form in the past but want to know more, this course is for you! The ideal candidate has experience using graphic design software such as Adobe InDesign, an open mind to making things with your hands, and a desire to explore the outer reaches of independent publishing.",

In the second class, participants will use the skills they’ve gained to create their own unique objects from scratch. A photo-un realistic dog? Maybe not at this point. A lumpy dog-shaped object? Perfect. The stranger it looks on your computer the better it prints.\nOn the final day, Brendan will walk students through the process of making 4 color Risograph prints of the work made in class.

Public environments like sidewalks, parks, and subway stations become places where memory, attention, and story intersect. These observations will become the foundation for meditative episodes, digressive accounts, and stream-of-consciousness vignettes that trace the interplay between outer world and inner life.\nSessions include three parts:\nTime spent in public space gathering material\nA focused in-class writing period with prompts\nOptional sharing and discussion.\nThis class is open to writers and artists of all levels who are curious about the relationship between attention, movement, and narrative.\nWe’ll draw inspiration from short, optional readings by writers such as Nicholson Baker, Teju Cole, Willa Cather, Virginia Woolf, and W.G. Sebald.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll leave with a body of new writing, sharpened observational tools, strategies for gathering material, and a renewed awareness of how the world around you can shape your creative practice.",

Every session, every participant will make something — with goals of lowering our own barriers to entry, freeing ourselves from overthinking, and using group accountability to encourage each other to create for the sake of creating.\nEach participant will also launch a low-stakes, high-joy personal project to an audience while exploring questions like:\nWhat is a “launch?” What is a “project?” What is an “audience?” Who do we make things for? Who would we rather make things for?\nWhat inspires us as humans vs. as workers?\nWhat would we make if we didn’t overthink? How do we get out of our own way?\nHow do we personally and collectively find joyful creative flow?\nParticipants do not need to have a personal project in mind before signing up. Some examples of low-stakes, high-joy personal projects from previous Launch courses:\nA crocheted outfit for a kitten.\nA Spotify-wrapped-style mobile experience based on a year's worth of Fitbit sleep data.\nThe first in a seven-part dinner party series where guests eat and wear only one color.\nA zine about sex positivity inspired by a tweenage fascination with the Nars Orgasm collection.\nA weekly series of Hallmark movie haiku reviews.\nA Matisse-ification tool for redesigning iconic visual artifacts of the 21st century inspired by the print that is in seemingly every StreetEasy staging photo.\nA pop-up restaurant menu based on ingredients from the course’s collective pantry.\nA microblog of useless car facts.\nThis course is for you if:\nYou make things or would like to make things in any medium.\nYou ever feel stuck or like you’re not sure which (if any) personal projects to pursue.\nYou’re looking to inject more spontaneity, community, and intention into your creative practice.\nYou’re interested in exploring creative work outside of its commercial value.\nThis course is not for you if:\nYou are hoping it will help you seek VC funding or a spot on Shark Tank (although “an illustrated zine ranking episodes of Shark Tank based on how much an actual shark would enjoy them” would make an incredible Launch project!)",

Over the course of 6 weeks, we will learn more about the revolutionary roots of independent publishing, and learn how to design and make physical zines.\nIf you’ve ever been curious about making a zine, or if you've experimented with the art form in the past but want to know more, this course is for you! The ideal candidate has experience using graphic design software such as Adobe InDesign, an open mind to making things with your hands, and a desire to explore the outer reaches of independent publishing.",

Then we’ll use that space to brainstorm and design a gift for a friend or loved one, and take what we’ve learned from the exercise and apply it to our everyday practice of making.",

The book isn't just about art; it promises to \nempower you with confidence and cultivate essential habits to ignite your artistic spark.\n A transformative experience, if you will. Whether you’re a writer with writers block, a painter who wants to be a pianist, or project manager looking for any creative outlet besides making your team’s Notion look pretty, the book is said to have alchemized a path.\nFor 12 weeks we’ll be meeting to weave together inspiring exercises, reflective practices, and supportive community connections. This will be a safe and uplifting space where we'll discover more about ourselves and who we want to be.\nFor those local to NYC we’ll meet IRL at Index over drinks and snacks - some weeks there’ll be optional social hours afterwards. And for those from afar, or for weeks you may be traveling, an asynchronous zoom will be setup. Regardless of where you are we’ll host an online portal to hold space for sharing and inspiration.\nAt the end of our joint experience you’ll have the option to contribute a piece of work to an editorial compilation that may take shape in the form of a physical or digital zine - we’ll vibe that out together.",

      "description": "Join us for a guest lecture by chef and cultural producer Ora Wise, who will guide us through an exploration of the radical politics of pleasure. When you live in a world designed to deny your existence, taking up space with your joy isn’t frivolous — it’s necessary.\nFrom Audre Lorde’s articulation of the power of the erotic to adrienne maree brown’s collected voices of Pleasure Activism, queers have always cultivated traditions of joyful resistance and militant joy. This work rejects both the puritanical bullshit that demonizes pleasure and the capitalist systems that commodify it. The question is: to what end? \nOra’s approach bridges the false divide between “hard” activism — organizing, protesting — and “soft” activism — beauty, care. Through a process of communal learning and reflection, we’ll consider how pleasure can be political, ethical, accessible, and generative — not an escape from struggle, but essential fuel for sustained resistance.\nThis event is in partnership with Queer Aperitivo, co-created by Ora, who will nourish us with exceptional snacks and refreshments.\nA portion of ticket sales will benefit the Food Security Program run by \nFIG NYC\n and \nColectivo Intercultural Transgrediendo\n for their queer/trans immigrant community in Queens.",

It will be an exploration of the inner voices we all have — those that have been handed down by our culture, our environment, older generations and our closest caregivers. And it will explore how we can understand these voices so that we may work through and eventually overcome them.\nExpect some tough questions, insightful conversation and a few breakout sessions to dissect inner dialogue with a small group.",

As a group, we will take a critical look at Machine Learning from the inside by making its core concepts & techniques more explicit and discussing its ethical dilemmas with real-world examples.\nThroughout a six-week program, participants will be equipped with creative and critical tools that allow them to develop their own projects and create alternative, inclusive visual narratives.\nYou can expect a lively, activity-driven learning environment, a multidisciplinary peer group, and plenty of in-class demos.

During each session, we will read aloud a chapter from \nAll About Love\n by bell hooks and give live reactions in the form of a round table discussion.\nThe beauty of collective reading is that all sessions are open and free flowing. If you missed a previous session, don’t fret — you can hop into any session without context. Collective reading requires less commitment than a traditional book club or reading circle. If you have a certain chapter you’d like to talk about with folks, then come to that session. No need to read ahead, just come with yourself and an open mind.\nWe will be starting with Chapter 1 in the first session so if you have time feel free to read the Preface and Introduction on your own. This event series requires that you, BYOT (bring your own text) whether that’s a hard copy, ebook, or pdf.\nLastly, we would like to thank our PALs for making this event series possible and completely free. To learn more about the impact of PALs, check out this page, \nhere\n.",

Each session we’ll pick a platform, discuss what its algorithms might be hiding, and then divide up into teams — divers, researchers, excavators, and cartographers — and plunge the platform’s depths for signs of life. We’ll use what we find as materials to create new works, talk about what we learned, and return to our days with water between our toes.\nTogether, we’ll plunge into the deepest darkest corners of the internet on our lunch break. Since this is a highly collaborative team workshop, attendance is limited to the first 100 signups. (You may choose to attend as many or as few expeditions as you like.)",

      "description": "As designers, we’re constantly navigating cycles of feedback to develop creative ideas with resonance and impact. \nIn this course, each student will develop a production-ready design concept, learning hard and soft skills on how to give and action creative feedback. We’ll push ourselves and one another to consider new perspectives, influences, and resources while learning what makes a creative concept resonant and meaningful. \nAs you hone your project concept, you’ll learn critical communication skills, setting you on a path for fruitful creative growth within — and beyond — your career as a designer. \nCome with a freelance or personal design project you’re embarking on, or develop a concept for your own website. We’ll explore how to find a unique, fundamental truth in every design problem, and build it into an actionable and beautiful creative concept. \nWhether you’re a freelancer needing to get out of your own head, a member of a creative team looking for new sources of inspiration, or an independent designer looking to ground your personal projects with an audience, this 4-week workshop offers an opportunity for designers to develop a viable design idea, practice presenting concepts with precision, and push each other’s work in new directions. \nWhile no specific skill level is required, all participants should be practicing graphic designers with a working understanding of composition, typography, color theory, art direction, and standard project lifecycles.",

Students with a strong interest in writing, photography, and archiving are encouraged to attend, although this should not prevent students of disparate disciplines from signing up.\nThrough group walks, lectures, readings, discussions, and artist visits we will survey the ways memory can be used as source material; how it can be documented, archived, accessed, and shaped to produce new bodies of work. Students will study a wide range of artwork, literature, music, film, oral histories, and archives which make distinctive use of memory.\nWe will suppliment our explorations with short excercises and assignments that utilize personal histories, journals, found material, online archives, and self-published publications. We will explore how we can effectively re-contextualize our own memories, construct new meaning, blur the lines between fact and fiction and develop a broader perspective of one’s lived experience and surroundings.",

      "description": "Our second cohort of Artistic Alchemy is much more than a book club. It is a creative community to take respite and cocoon, to incubate your ideas and form your chrysalis, to transmute your creative desires and to take flight to your goals.\nIn addition to working through the book together, your instructor Ella will meet with you for individualized creative production sessions to help you conjure, set, and achieve your creative goals. Whether you’re a writer with writer’s block, a painter who dreams of playing the piano, or a project manager seeking a creative outlet other than beautifying your team’s Notion, this process is sure to alchemize artistic action.\nAt the foundation of our course, we will work through the cult classic, The Artist’s Way—a book that promises to empower you with confidence and cultivate essential habits to ignite your artistic spark. The book itself is a deeply introspective and personal journey that proves most effective when paired with a space for accountability and connection. Thus, for 13 weeks, we'll meet via Zoom (and one-on-one) to weave together its inspiring exercises and proven practices with Ella’s expertise in nurturing creative development. Through this process we'll discover more about ourselves and who we want to be, while also developing bonds and fostering new creative relationships.\nWhen and where the time-space continuum allows, we'll gather for meet-ups. Some of last year’s excursions included meditative birding in Prospect Park, a zine-making workshop at Pioneer Works, and numerous dinner parties across North and Central America. At the end of our joint experience you’ll have the option to contribute a piece of work to a editorial compilation that may take shape in the form of a physical or digital zine, we’ll vibe that out together. Check out last year’s digital zine \nhere\n. \nThe outcomes of this process are endless! Members of our last cohort achieved amazing accomplishments: they finished writing albums, changed career directions, bought their first apartments, reignited their passion for painting, relocated across the globe, authored books, embraced public speaking, quit their damn day jobs to start a gallery, and, most importantly, forged connections that up lift and inspire them to shine as their shiny artist selves in their daily lives.",

      "description": "Since 2021, we’ve been offering installments of Intro to Coding for Designers to dozens of our peers who have left the course with projects that show their design practice in a whole new light. For the first time ever, Index is offering a version of Intro to Coding for students to take on their own schedule, at their own pace.\nLearn foundational skills in web development with HTML and CSS, while responding to creative prompts and immersing yourself in a feminist, counter-cultural history of the internet.\nIn 7 30–60 minute chapters along with a few creative tutorials called ‘experiments,’ you’ll learn new skills in programming and begin to use code as a creative medium. Each chapter, you’ll be guided by readings and prompted to participate in discussions in Discord about life on the internet. Play, pause, and return to course materials any time as you learn at the pace that’s right for you.\nThroughout the class, students will work on a personal web zine on a topic of their choice, leaving class with a completed, interactive, browser-based project. \nWhat sets this course apart from other coding courses is the lesson on content management systems (CMS) with Kirby. You will learn how to create a fully functional CMS to allow you to build sites for others to update the website without having to code. Perfect for team collaboration!\nGet access to resources like code snippets, readings, and references from within and beyond the Index community, students will learn foundational tools for self-publishing and archiving on the internet.",

      "description": "Reflect on your personal collections and establish a creative archiving practice in this two day workshop.\nDesigners, artists, and researchers alike are invited to bring their to-do lists, diary entries, scraps, fragments and in-process work to analyze, discover common threads, and find focus\nSpread the artifacts of your creative practice out in front of you, and out in front of the community. Can we use this space to reflect, discuss, reformat, curate, and question the things we make, supported by and in conversation with one another? What themes may emerge that were previously buried? What possibilities can we reveal by seeing our own works from different vantage points?\nPart group critique, part writing workshop, part reflective residency, this workshop invites you to develop a creative archiving practice for your artist practice, diary entries, collection of writings, and more. Outputs will vary, but may look like:\nwebsite of archived writing entries\nphotography series of your collection of artifacts you have crafted yourself\ndrawings that are inspired by a collection of diary entries made into gifs\na monthly newsletter to your friends of your weekly grocery lists\nPlease come to class having read the supplied pre-reading (available after registration) about indexing, catalog theory, and artist archives. We will discuss together during Introductions and Part One of the workshop.\nJessie McCarty's Indexing Are.na page",

      "description": "The internet was designed to be decentralized and enable individuals to publish and share information online. And since 2003, the open source blogging platform “Wordpress” continues to power a whopping 35% of the entire web. Still the word “blog” brings about ideas of souped-up recipe sites that are optimized to increase ad revenue rather than accessibility. However, on an internet dominated by consolidated mega-platforms hell bent on keeping you on their website at all costs, building a personal site or blog is independent publishing. Learn how to publish content on your own personal blog and connect it to an rss feed reader.",

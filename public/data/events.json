We'll explore the new tools helping women understand their bodies- from biomarkers to blueprints, & the care models that reflect the way we actually live.\r If you building in or are curious about women's health, if you believe longevity should be intelligent & inclusive, if you're ready to see what happens when data meets design with empathy-this is the room to be in. This isn't your mom's healthcare system anymore.\r This event is a part of #NYTechWeek-a week of events hosted by VCs & startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

But that's changing. Join us for a conversation about how data, design, & a new generation of women-led innovation are bringing visibility, intelligence, & continuity to women's health.\r Join us for a fireside chat featuring three women deeply immersed in reimagining care:\r - Dr Estelle Giraud, PhD co-founder & CEO of Trellis Health, building the infrastructure for generational health\r- Dr. Hillary Lin, a physician-entrepreneur & cofounder of elevateX, elevating healthcare via AI-enabled precision longevity\r- Naseem Sayani, investor at How Women Invest & previously founding partner at Emmeline Ventures, backing the startups reshaping women's lived experience through health, finance, & family systems.\r Together, they'll unpack the new science of women's health, the emerging companies & trends in venture investment across the category, & the growing business models & access points for consumers. We'll explore the new tools helping women understand their bodies- from biomarkers to blueprints, & the care models that reflect the way we actually live.\r If you building in or are curious about women's health, if you believe longevity should be intelligent & inclusive, if you're ready to see what happens when data meets design with empathy-this is the room to be in. This isn't your mom's healthcare system anymore.\r This event is a part of #NYTechWeek-a week of events hosted by VCs & startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

The more our lives move online & our interactions get mediated by machines, the more we miss & crave physical interactions with other humans & the world around us.\r This is why we are so excited to bring a unique panel of founders building in the experiential economy space to Tech Week to discuss what they are building, current trends, pitfalls & opportunities in the space, & where they see the space going in the next decade.  We will not only discuss trends in direct-to-consumer experiences but also cover how various businesses have excelled in using IRL opportunities for customer activation or employee retention.   We will also discuss what it's like to fundraise in the space.  The night will end with time for networking with others passionate about the IRL Renaissance happening today.\r PANELISTS:\r Radha Agrawal: Co-founder & CEO of Daybreaker, the global morning dance, music & wellness movement with a community of half a million people. Radha is also an angel investor in mostly female owned businesses.\r Justin Bolognino: Pioneer in immersive experiences that fuse technology, design, & human connection. As the founder of META & Unreality, Justin & his team have crafted multi-sensory experiences for Spotify, Google, & Samsung in collaboration with artists like St. Vincent & Skrillex for Coachella & SXSW.\r Virginia Frischkorn: Founder & CEO of Partytrick, a software platform revolutionizing how experiences are planned, executed, & scaled through smart design & data-driven insights.

      "description": "Join us for an electrifying Pitch Showcase during Tech Week, presented by Seedlegals & organized by Coeus Collective, with support from J.P. Morgan Innovation Economy!\r If you are a FOUNDER interested in PRESENTING, start here! (If you're just interested in attending, we'd love to see you at the Showcase! Just skip the next few paragraphs.)\r FOUNDERS: Welcome to what is set to be a highly anticipated event this New York Tech Week. The goal of this event is a pitch showcase that promotes mentorship for early-stage founders. Pre-seed & seed-stage startups in all industries are encouraged to participate!\r All founders interested in presenting must fill out the four founder-specific questions in the questionnaire here on Partiful. Based off this questionnaire, a select group of founders will be selected as finalists for a mentorship round. These finalists will be presenting on June 3, & each finalist will be paired with one of the following mentors:\r  David S. Rose (Managing Partner, Rose Tech Ventures & Founder & Chairman Emeritus, New York Angels)\r Norma A. Padrn, Ph.D. (Vice President, J.P. Morgan)\r David Kullmann (Venture Partner, Late Stage Capital)\r Ren Bastn (Venture Partner, Covenant Venture Capital)\r David Attermann (Head of Web3 Investments, M31 Capital)\r We will assign mentors two weeks prior to the Showcase date at the latest. Each of these mentors have already confirmed their capability to take on mentorship of multiple teams & connect with founders to review their pitch.\r Selected mentors will also be serving as judges on the big pitch showcase night!\r FOR NON-PRESENTING ATTENDEES:\r Please RSVP, but no need for you to fill out the presenter-specific questions in the questionnaire of course!\r Whether you are a founder, investor, operator, or startup fanatic generally, we hope to see you live & in-person on Tuesday, June 3. Watch as 10-12 highly vetted startups present their companies to potential investors, corporate partners, & customers during New York Tech Week.\r WHAT TO EXPECT:\r - Dynamic startup pitches from highly-vetted emerging entrepreneurs\r- Networking with investors, founders, & fellow tech enthusiasts\r- Light refreshments, food, & an energetic start to your Tuesday evening!\r DISCLAIMER: This pitch showcase is designed as a supportive platform for founders to receive valuable feedback & mentorship, rather than a traditional competition. While participants will benefit from expert guidance & networking opportunities within the VC ecosystem during the Showcase & the mentorship matching process, please note that no financial awards or monetary prizes will be presented as part of this event. The value for founders lies in the connections made at the Showcase, feedback received from mentors, & the opportunity to showcase their ventures to the broader New York Tech Week community. Additionally, no offer to invest in any of the founders participating in this Showcase at any stage is being made by any of the organizers, sponsors, supporters, judges, mentors, or attendees; neither is any offer for investment being solicited from the audience at the Pitch Showcase nor any member of the broader New York Tech Week community of attendees, sponsors, & affiliates.\r This event is organized by Coeus Collective.\r  Coeus Collective is a founder-powered media & community platform elevating the most innovative minds in entrepreneurship, technology, & venture capital. Through podcasts, events, & digital media storytelling, we help founders & VCs develop their audience of builders & innovators. Past events have featured Daniel Lubetzky (KIND Bars, Shark Tank), Michael Baum (Splunk), & Siya Raj Purohit (OpenAI). The Coeus Collective Podcast is currently live on our Coeus Collective YouTube channel & all audio platforms!\r This event is a part of #NYTechWeek-a week of events hosted by VCs & startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Morgan Innovation Economy!\r If you are a FOUNDER interested in PRESENTING, start here! (If you're just interested in attending, we'd love to see you at the Showcase! Just skip the next few paragraphs.)\r FOUNDERS: Welcome to what is set to be a highly anticipated event this New York Tech Week. The goal of this event is a pitch showcase that promotes mentorship for early-stage founders. Pre-seed & seed-stage startups in all industries are encouraged to participate!\r All founders interested in presenting must fill out the four founder-specific questions in the questionnaire here on Partiful. Based off this questionnaire, a select group of founders will be selected as finalists for a mentorship round. These finalists will be presenting on June 3, & each finalist will be paired with one of the following mentors:\r  David S. Rose (Managing Partner, Rose Tech Ventures & Founder & Chairman Emeritus, New York Angels)\r Norma A. Padrn, Ph.D. (Vice President, J.P. Morgan)\r David Kullmann (Venture Partner, Late Stage Capital)\r Ren Bastn (Venture Partner, Covenant Venture Capital)\r David Attermann (Head of Web3 Investments, M31 Capital)\r We will assign mentors two weeks prior to the Showcase date at the latest. Each of these mentors have already confirmed their capability to take on mentorship of multiple teams & connect with founders to review their pitch.\r Selected mentors will also be serving as judges on the big pitch showcase night!\r FOR NON-PRESENTING ATTENDEES:\r Please RSVP, but no need for you to fill out the presenter-specific questions in the questionnaire of course!\r Whether you are a founder, investor, operator, or startup fanatic generally, we hope to see you live & in-person on Tuesday, June 3. Watch as 10-12 highly vetted startups present their companies to potential investors, corporate partners, & customers during New York Tech Week.\r WHAT TO EXPECT:\r - Dynamic startup pitches from highly-vetted emerging entrepreneurs\r- Networking with investors, founders, & fellow tech enthusiasts\r- Light refreshments, food, & an energetic start to your Tuesday evening!\r DISCLAIMER: This pitch showcase is designed as a supportive platform for founders to receive valuable feedback & mentorship, rather than a traditional competition. While participants will benefit from expert guidance & networking opportunities within the VC ecosystem during the Showcase & the mentorship matching process, please note that no financial awards or monetary prizes will be presented as part of this event. The value for founders lies in the connections made at the Showcase, feedback received from mentors, & the opportunity to showcase their ventures to the broader New York Tech Week community. Additionally, no offer to invest in any of the founders participating in this Showcase at any stage is being made by any of the organizers, sponsors, supporters, judges, mentors, or attendees; neither is any offer for investment being solicited from the audience at the Pitch Showcase nor any member of the broader New York Tech Week community of attendees, sponsors, & affiliates.\r This event is organized by Coeus Collective.\r  Coeus Collective is a founder-powered media & community platform elevating the most innovative minds in entrepreneurship, technology, & venture capital. Through podcasts, events, & digital media storytelling, we help founders & VCs develop their audience of builders & innovators. Past events have featured Daniel Lubetzky (KIND Bars, Shark Tank), Michael Baum (Splunk), & Siya Raj Purohit (OpenAI). The Coeus Collective Podcast is currently live on our Coeus Collective YouTube channel & all audio platforms!\r This event is a part of #NYTechWeek-a week of events hosted by VCs & startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

It was terrible, but at least it wasn't owned by a dude who likes making \"roman salutes.\" After you divest from your SpaceX stock and sell your Tesla, come on down to NYC Resistor, where we'll show you how to ditch X but keep a personal copy of your favorite posts using Cyd.\nBefore the workshop: Make sure you can log on to X on your laptop (not your phone, your laptop) and once logged in, request an archive of your tweets using these instructions: https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-x-archive. Please do this step at least a week before the workshop, as it may take X a few to several days to process the archive request.BONUS: We'll also help you sign up for Mastodon, an X alternative, if you want.\nThis event is donate what-you-wish.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

In this class you'll learn everything you need.Harness the power of an Epilog 60 Watt Laser! In this class you'll learn everything you need to know to make the ideas in your head become a reality with a laser.\nIn this three hour class, you will learn:\nHow to set up a file for cutting on the laser cutter in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.Laser cutter safety including materials testing.Laser cutter operation including configuration, cuts and raster etching in common materials like wood, acrylic, cardboard and others.At the end of class, you will go home with:\nOne laser cut project, either the class default or a simple one of your own design (see below for details)Resistor Laser Certification, enabling you to use our laser on Craft Nights.Please bring the following to class:\nA laptop with either Inkscape (free: download here: https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.2.1/) or Adobe Illustrator installed.\nA USB jump drive\nThe following items are optional if you'd like to try cutting a simple custom design. If your file ends up being too complicated, we may have you do the class default project first, just to learn the laser in the time allotted - but we'll definitely help you with your more complex cut at a free Craft Night in future!\nAn SVG vector file of a simple shape you'd like to cut for your first cut.A piece of 1/8 inch or thinner wood, acrylic or cardboard you'd like to cut. If you can't bring your own material, small pieces will be made available, or larger pieces for purchase on site.Please be on time for the start of class! If you're late you will miss your slot.\nThis class will be taught by NYC Resistor member Woody. As with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 72 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

      "description": "​Genome editing tools allow the introduction of precise changes in the DNA. For this ability, they became indispensable for basic biological research and hold great promise for future therapeutic applications. The same technologies are being utilized also in early human embryos for better understanding of key developmental regulators and DNA repair mechanisms. In the future, precise correction of specific genes might enable curing devastating diseases early in the development or decreasing the risks of certain diseases. Although continuous research is needed before such an intervention becomes safe, the first gene-edited babies were already born. This talk aims to contribute to the debate about human germline gene editing by putting it into a broader context of human biology, discussing the benefits, current limitations, and possible future alternatives leading to the prevention of genetic diseases.Stepan Jerabek is a postdoctoral research scientist in the Pediatrics Department at Columbia University. He is also an associate scientist at IOCB Prague, an institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Stepan’s interest in early development and genome stability brought him to the Egli laboratory, where he uses genome editing tools to study DNA repair in human preimplantation embryos. In 2024, Stepan was the recipient of the Druckenmiller Fellowship Award from the New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute. Stepan completed his doctoral training at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Germany and was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, working in the lab of genetics pioneer George Church.🐦Stay Connected about Future Events:Twitter:@descinyc_Instagram:@descinyc​PS: Apply to be a member of the DeSci NYC group chat:https://forms.gle/AmUtotmCgWgGxWDp6",

      "description": "​Hi, I'm Liam Rosen, and I'm the only person self-aggrandizing enough to use my name in an event description (theMavis Beaconreference just had to be made).​There are a lot of great thinkers, visionaries, hackers, and engineers hanging around Fractal Tech, but all the building and theorizing in the world won't bring a product to market.​LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE MUST SELL.​This is a pilot small-group workshop, targeting the 5-8 people that need it the most. I will solicit applications and select a group for this first session.​The session will be light on theory and heavy on practice: we will spend most of the time with students rotating mock discovery calls in front of the group. I will act as the buyer, putting on a challenging persona that will force you to level up. We'll then do group feedback.​This is ideal for those with a bit of experience who want to learn more, or if you're experiencing sticking points in your sales process that you need to work through.​This means you must have a tangible product or service that you are already selling — in other words, you should come in with some past history of talking to your customers. (There will be other events catering to those looking to dip their toes into the sales world.)​Other than that,anyone can apply! I love meeting and  helping new people, so even if you don't know me or haven't been to Fractal Tech before, please throw your name in the hat.​Why learn from me:​I've been selling for 10 years. I currently lead the sales team forTopScore, a sports SaaS company. I joined in 2014 as the first salesperson and grew the company from 80K to 1.3MM in revenue and a successful exit.​I love to teach and I learned most of what I know through training others. I now run asales consultancywhere I show founders how to sell their product and help them build out their sales strategy.​I abhor sales bros, bullshit-talkers, and amoral coercing. My sales style is radically honest and unashamedly disqualificatory. I teach consultative sales that openly gives away advice and closes only if there's a strong mutual fit.​I emphasize sales psychology backed by real research: small tweaks to tonality, body language, cadence, framing, and other interpersonal skills can make or break a deal in the first 30 seconds of a call​More about mehere.​If you think you'd like to take the plunge, apply above.",

      "description": "​Data and the distribution of decision-making power is an increasingly important dynamic to understand and engage with in climate and energy. Who is collecting, analyzing, and presenting data - how and why? These are the hard-hitting questions we will unpack in an open format discussion. If you have been looking for a space to share and engage with multiple perspectives through concrete examples of data’s influence within climate and energy decision-making, this event is for you!​*Note: This is a small group discussion so that we can dive deep into Data In Power principles and examples while building relationships. If you are interested, please RSVP even if the event is full, so that I can plan more for the calendar.​Data In Power is an independently run meetup without any bells and whistles. To maintain our community and sustain organic growth, please support our venue with a refreshment purchase and join the group to share perspectives on the dynamic between data and decision-making.",

      "description": "​Join us for a visit to the Lubalin Archives at The Cooper Union.The Lubalin Center preserves the work of Herb Lubalin and other designers through an archive that includes drawings, type specimens, posters, logos, and advertising materials. Lubalin is a goated American Graphic Designer and this growing archive contain works not only by him but also Paul Rand, Milton Glaser, Massimo Vignelli, and many others.​The archive isn’t digitized so you literally won’t be able to find its stuff on are.na, Pinterest, google images etc. We’re moving beyond aesthetics and engaging with materiality and context, folks! As someone who has visited the archives, I’d say it contains some of the best design references in the country.​We’re getting a hands-on presentation of a selection of material which lasts about an hour and a half. The presentation is different every time and tailored to the group, so even if you’ve been to the archives before, it’s unlikely that the presentation will be the same. It's a closer look at some of the objects in the collection, the stories behind them, and what they can teach us about making work today. The emphasis is on ways we can make active use of design history as contemporary practitioners. The curators will use physical examples from the collection to construct specific case studies of ways we can look at objects to inform today's design decisions.​The Center usually doesn’t host groups past 3 PM, but they’ve graciously agreed to keep the archive open for us until 6 PM on Friday, allowing for a 4 PM start. You may need to leave work a little early, but it’s a Friday and well worth it.",

There will be plenty of space to dance, and also to just hangout and chat with old and new friends. Anyone is welcome, so please feel free to spread the word!\n\nA $15 entry fee will be collected via Venmo at the door, and we will also have merchandise and other goodies available for purchase. All funds from the night will be going toward the budget for our film.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure to follow us on IG: @seppukuinthepark and check out our Seed & Spark page in order to stay up to date with our progress and events.\n\nThank you to everyone who has already supported us on this journey for your love and generosity! We truly couldn't do this without you all, and we can't wait to bring this story to life <3\n\nFull details at: https://partiful.com/e/3UjmzeRVPdSPb9JXKTzW",

Building your own gear doesn't have to be a solitary hobby anymore... has regular meetups to share recent DIY audio projects (speakers, amps, DACs, etc - anything home-audio related), as well as talks and demos on related topics and skills (how to solder, how digital crossovers work, fabrication techniques, digital room correction, etc).\nThis month we'll show you how to build your own Raspberry Pi streamer (anyone can build one of these!), as well as some new speaker and amp projects members are working on.\n(If history is any guide, at the end of the meetup some of us will want to keep talking about projects and we'll move to a bar nearby - join us!)\nHave a project you'd like to share? We want to hear about it. Have a project to share? Email diyaudio@gowanusaudio.com with the details.\nWho should come?\nOpen to anyone interested in DIY home audio who wants to learn and make some new friends - all experience levels welcome. If you've ever wanted to build any audio gear, we're here for you. (We generally don't focus on production, live sound, musical instruments, or making music, although there certainly is some overlap.)\nNote from the organizer, Pete:\nI started diyaudio.nyc a couple years ago because I wanted to meet some like-minded folks near me - I knew they were out there. And they are! Thank you for being a part! Let's grow this group! These days, for me, it's all audio all the time - I work as a Buyer for The Music Room buying high end audio equipment, and also offer complete classes to build your own equipment as Gowanus Audio.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct.

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance.

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance.

We use the word “propaganda” because this work is not neutral—we’re proudly supporting our gender-expansive community.",

      "description": "A community panel discussion and live broadcast on Radio AlHara, PalestineSaturday, Feb. 15, 5PM (doors) 6PM (panel)\n\n\nFeaturing :\n\n\nNadia Khayrallah\n, Dancers for Palestine\n\n\nSam Sundos\n, Palestinian-American interdisciplinary artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY\n\n\nYasmeen Abdallah\n, Artist and co-founder of Fiber Friends of Falastin\n\n\nLianah, Theater Workers for a Ceasefire\n\n\nDiscussion hosted by Montreal based musician and community organizer \nStefan Christoff\n.\n\n\nOrganized in collaboration with Interference Archive.\n\n\nThis event brings together a panel of cultural workers from the New York City area who have been actively organizing and taking collective action to support Palestine over the last year. This community panel discussion at \nInterference Archive\n will stream live globally at \nradioalhara.net\n and also directly at \nThe Wonder Cabinet\n in Bethlehem, Palestine. \n\n\nThe goal of this event is to highlight the ways that cultural work is a key part of both broader community organizing practices and the contemporary movement to support Palestine. This discussion aims to highlight the ways that cultural work occurs as part of a process of exchange between artistic ideas but also organizational strategies that are built across grassroots organizing networks.\n\n\nThis panel builds on similar live community discussions with cultural workers that have recently taken place in other cities, also broadcast on Radio AlHara and hosted by Stefan Christoff, including in July 2024 at \nCasa do Comum\n in Lisbon, Portugal, in Amsterdam in Nov. at \nOT301\n, in Mexico City in Feb. 2024 at Radio Nopal (\naudio\n) and in Sofia, Bulgaria at the \nкоприва Feminist cultural space\n. \n\n\nInformation on the speakers and participating groups / collectives:\n\n\nDrawing from the personal and the political through resilience and persistence, \nYasmeen Abdallah\n references her Levantine lineage in the form of magic carpets, intimate weaving, and needle art practices. Abdallah seeks to create safe, mobile spaces in the face of occupying forces that cruelly and catastrophically fail humanity. She views the threaded needle as a tool of solidarity to rip through borders, unravel fictive allegories, and heal holes in tender hearts. Abdallah holds Bachelor’s degrees from University of Massachusetts in Anthropology (emphasis in Historical & Collaborative Archaeology, which included field schools with New England indigenous tribal communities); and another in Studio Art with honors, including a Minor in Women’s, Gender & Sexuality Studies. Abdallah also earned an MFA in Fine Arts with distinction from Pratt Institute. Her work as an artist, curator, writer, and educator is rooted in social engagement and collaborative work with various communities and DIY spaces including ABC No Rio; Art in Odd Places; Flux Factory; and Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space. She has been a visiting and teaching artist at institutions including New Museum; Pratt Institute; Sarah Lawrence; Residency Unlimited; BRIC; Kean University; Parsons; Children’s Museum of NYC; El Barrio Artspace; Fairleigh Dickinson; and University of Massachusetts. \n\n\nDancers for Palestine\n (D4P) is an autonomous group of dance workers who organize in solidarity with the global movement for Palestinian liberation. Formed during Israel’s genocidal attack on Gaza beginning in 2023, D4P seeks to both cohere and create a dance community which is vocal and active in its support of the Palestinian people. D4P is a local and international endeavor with a core organizing group in NYC and an ever expanding network of dancers and organizers. D4P’s work has included protest and direct action, political education events, art-based fundraising, and campaigns to move dance institutions into alignment with the Palestinian Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.\n\n\nFiber Friends of Falastin\n is an exploratory social activity for folks who have basic crochet, knitting, sewing, quilting, weaving, embroidery, (and more!) skills. Taking place at Interference Archive, this is open to all who are interested in building community at the intersection of textile-making and social movements, where work is created in support of Palestine. \n\n\nSam Sundos\n is a Palestinian-American interdisciplinary artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY. Through his paintings & textiles Sundos references his experience as a Palestinian born & raised in diaspora while applying the use of traditional slow craft processes and cultural iconography. Through incorporating his personal experience to these processes Sundos’ hopes to use his voice to advance conversations centering around imperialism & its socioeconomic effects while remaining grounded in themes of indigeneity & tradition. In short, through his art, Sundos seeks to convey the significance of human touch and the value of every human life. Sundos has also recently founded \nUnibrow Sun\n, an organization prioritizing artists & activists whose work is focused on elevating narratives of solidarity through exhibitions, screening, workshops & printed material.\n\n\nTheater Workers for a Ceasefire\n exists to organize U.S.-based theater workers in solidarity with the people of Palestine. We aim to use our bodies and talents in pursuit of a comprehensive ceasefire, which we understand is merely the first step among many in realizing a Free Palestine.",

Volunteers will give a brief overview of patches as an aspect of punk and DIY culture, we’ll take a look together at some materials in the archive, and we’ll also host a participatory demonstration on how to make and sew your own patches.\n\n\nThis event will take place in person at the archive on Monday, February 10th at 6:30pm. We’ll have some limited supplies available on a first come, first serve basis, but bring something to sew your patch onto as well as any other supplies you might feel like using (tough fabric scraps, needle, thread, fabric markers).",

We point out genericness conditions related to reachability of zero loss minimization, in underparametrized versus overparametrized Deep Learning (DL) networks. For underparametrized DL networks, we explicitly construct global, zero loss cost minimizers for sufficiently clustered data. In addition, we derive effective equations governing the cumulative biases and weights, and show that gradient descent corresponds to a dynamical process in the input layer, whereby clusters of data are progressively reduced in complexity (&amp;quot;truncated&amp;quot;) at an exponential rate that increases with the number of data points that have already been truncated. For overparametrized DL networks, we prove that the gradient descent flow is homotopy equivalent to a geometrically adapted flow that induces a (constrained) Euclidean gradient flow in output space. If a certain rank condition holds, the latter is, upon reparametrization of the time variable, equivalent to simple linear interpolation. This in turn implies zero loss minimization and the phenomenon known as &amp;ldquo;Neural Collapse&amp;rdquo;. Moreover, we derive zero loss guarantees, and construct explicit global minimizers for overparametrized deep networks, given generic training data. The work presented includes collaborations with Patricia Munoz Ewald and Andrew G. Moore (UT Austin).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In person attendance at this seminar is only open to Columbia Univesity affiliates. External guests are welcome to attend remotely.

Against common framings of queer politics as either a progressive campaign for state recognition or as a subcultural rejection of prevailing gender norms, it provides an alternative view of queer radicalism that clarifies its true scale. Revisiting the gay liberation movement, Black lesbian feminism, and AIDS activism, it explores the relationship between struggles for sexual freedom and questions of capital accumulation, empire, and state violence. The queer radical tradition is shown to have not only conditioned the trajectory of LGBTI history, but also to have radicalized wider anti-imperialist, socialist, and abolitionist struggles past and present.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr.&amp;nbsp;Alex Stoffel is an Assistant Professor&amp;nbsp;in International Politics at Queen Mary University of London. His research takes up critical questions regarding the intersections of sexuality, race, and desire within capitalist expansion. He has published in, among other journals,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;International Studies Quarterly&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Journal of International Relations&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The International Feminist Journal of Politics&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Salvage&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and is an editor of the journal&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Historical Materialism&lt;/em&gt;, where he convenes the Sexuality and Political Economy Network.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Response will be given by Tulio Bucchioni, PhD candidate in LAIC/ICLS/ISSG.

The European Central Bank is firmly established as the #2 central bank in the world. It has survived years of turbulence. For now, debt markets are stable and the politics of Europe&amp;#39;s common currency are quiet. Can this last?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEurope faces huge challenges. Its economy is sluggish. Europe fears falling behind in the global tech race. It faces new security threats. Trans-Atlantic relations have been thrown into turmoil by the reelection of Donald Trump.

Across the Western Hemisphere,&amp;nbsp;organizations and movements have emerged that are&amp;nbsp;focused on issues facing women in the public square, themes like leadership development, representation in politics, and online violence. What do these initiatives signal about changes in the broader political landscape and the emergence of new political&amp;nbsp;leadership? How do they interact with traditional political structures and&amp;nbsp;forms of participation?

Jackson Women&amp;rsquo;s Health Organization&lt;/em&gt; decision in June 2022 removed federal protections for the right to abortion, fundamentally changing the abortion landscape in the United States. This seminar will present first-of-its kind evidence on the unequal impact of the &lt;em&gt;Dobbs &lt;/em&gt;decision on fertility rates and infant mortality, both across and within states, and by several subgroups. Drawing from vital statistics and US Census Bureau data from 2012 through 2023 for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, this study uses a Bayesian panel data model to evaluate state-by-subgroup specific changes in fertility and infant mortality associated with complete or 6-week abortion bans in 14 US states.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suzanne Bell&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Leonard Nimoy remembers Isaiah as &amp;ldquo;endlessly creative.&amp;rdquo; Jane Curtin thought &amp;ldquo;he was so much fun.&amp;rdquo; Isaiah Sheffer had a unique wit and humor that suffused everything he did. &amp;ldquo;There is no one like him,&amp;rdquo; said Stephen Lang.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The documentary delves into the life of the man whom many knew only as the host of Selected Shorts on public radio, or the driving force and artistic director of Symphony Space, or the originator of Bloomsday on Broadway, or the comic genius behind the Thalia Follies. In addition to all of those successes he was an Emmy-nominated writer and producer. He was an actor, director, musical librettist and lyricist, and a cultural entrepreneur. He was a husband and father, and a mentor to many.

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;Join us in March when NECR program director Dr. Beth Fisher-Yoshida discusses negotiation with Visiting Scholar.Julia Vassileva.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe webinar discusses Julia&amp;rsquo;s research, which investigates the low levels of women&amp;rsquo;s inclusion in peace negotiations in post-Soviet states, focusing on conflicts in regions such as Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Transnistria. Based on fieldwork she conducted in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Moldova (over 120 interviews), it highlights the unique challenges women face in these high-stakes negotiations. The research comes amid global rising tensions, particularly after Russia&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, which has highlighted unresolved conflicts in post-Soviet Eastern Europe. The work seeks to bridge theory and practice by detailing the barriers to women&amp;rsquo;s participation, and it speaks to the importance of ensuring more effective, sustainable, and inclusive peace negotiations in the region and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This event will be held online.

This treaty, years in the making, seeks to fill a significant gap in international law and provide greater accountability for the systematic and widespread atrocities committed against civilian populations. The UN General Assembly&amp;#39;s Sixth Committee recently took a momentous step by agreeing to begin drafting the treaty, signaling a pivotal moment in multilateral diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Drawing from her experience representing Mexico in critical UN committees, Ana Paula will provide insights into the treaty negotiation process, the complexities of building international consensus, and the challenges of overcoming opposition from certain states. She will also explore how this treaty aims to address some of the most egregious human rights violations of our time, from genocide to torture, and discuss the path ahead for the treaty&amp;#39;s drafting and eventual adoption.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is co-sponsored by the Columbia Law Students Human Rights Association, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, and the Columbia Human Rights Law Review&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Thursday, March 13, 2025 | 12:10pm - 1:10pm&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Columbia Law School | Jerome Greene Annex&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Columbia Law School, 435 West 116th Street, New York)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lunch will be provided.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please register below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Event Contact Information:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nManmeet Kaur Nijjer&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"mailto:mkn2123@columbia.edu\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mkn2123@columbia.edu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, in 1974, the American Psychiatric Association, following controversial debates, held an unprecedented vote to decide that homosexuality should no longer be listed as a &amp;ldquo;disease&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Yet controversies have continued over how medicine and society should view queer identities, including, most recently, transgender individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Join us and a panel of experts for an exploration of these historical and ongoing tensions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ronald Bayer, Ph.D., &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Professor of Sociomedical Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gina Chua, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Executive Editor, Semafor&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tia Powell, M.D., &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Professor of Epidemiology and Psychiatry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center; Cofounder, Slow Code Media&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderated By:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Klitzman, M.D.,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Program Director, Bioethics; Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University Irving Medical Center&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is cosponsored by the &lt;a href=\"https://makinggayhistory.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making Gay History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://makinggayhistory.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making Gay History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that addresses the absence of substantive, in-depth LGBTQ+-inclusive American history from the public discourse and the classroom.

Southern Iran. The people of Abadan have been fighting an Iraqi siege. Amongst them is the 14-year-old Omid, who chose to stay in the city with his grandfather, waiting for his elder brother to return from the frontline. But how can you resist in a war without taking up arms?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then Omid finds an abandoned ship in Abadan&amp;rsquo;s harbor. Is this the answer to saving the people he loves?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trailer &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/1YC5g-gWdBE?si=ReGhq5I9AfTeFtli\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sepideh Farsi&lt;/strong&gt; is a Franco-Iranian film director known for her poignant exploration of identity and exile. Born in Iran, she left the country in 1984 to study mathematics in Paris but soon shifted her focus to the visual arts, beginning with photography before transitioning to filmmaking. Farsi&amp;#39;s films, celebrated for their bold storytelling, have consistently challenged the Iranian regime. Since 2009, she has been unable to return to Iran due to her activism and the critical nature of her work. All of her films remain banned in the country. In February 2023, her first animated feature, &lt;em&gt;The Siren (La Sir&amp;egrave;ne)&lt;/em&gt;, premiered as the opening film of the Panorama section at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival. The film later won Best Animated Film at the 16th Asia Pacific Screen Awards in Gold Coast, Australia, in November 2023.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Aubrey Gabel&lt;/strong&gt; is Assistant Professor of French at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced by Maison Fran&amp;ccedil;aise and co-sponsored by the MESAAS and Middle East Institute at Columbia University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

These data are acquired before therapy begins, and again at one or more time points during therapy. All model parameters that are not directly measured are calibrated to the longitudinal imaging data from a patient. Then, the personalized model is run forward to predict tumor size and other characteristics of the patient&amp;rsquo;s tumor at future times which can be directly tested against observation and, ultimately, guide intervention. &amp;nbsp;In this presentation, we will provide an overview of this effort through four vignettes focusing on 1) incorporating patient-specific data into biology-based mathematical models, 2) simulating outcomes via digital twins, 3) guiding interventions through optimal control theory, and 4) updating interventions through data assimilation. To tell a complete story we will focus on breast cancer, but also summarize our efforts in brain, cervical, and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Thomas Yankeelov, PhD,&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Director of Center for Computational Oncology, UT Austin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tom Yankeelov received an MA in Applied Mathematics and an MS in Physics from Indiana University, before completing the PhD in Biomedical Engineering at SUNY @ Stony Brook.&amp;nbsp; He completed his post-doc with Dr. John Gore at the Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science and climbed the ranks to Full Professor in 2010.&amp;nbsp; He then joined the faculty at The University of Texas at Austin in 2016 where he is now the Moncrief Chair of Computational Oncology and Professor of Biomedical Engineering and&amp;nbsp;Diagnostic Medicine.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Yankeelov is the founding Director of the Center for Computational Oncology and also serves as co-Director for the Quantitative Oncology Research Program within the Livestrong Cancer Institutes at UT Austin.&amp;nbsp; He is also an Adjunct Professor of Imaging Physics at MD Anderson Cancer Center.&amp;nbsp; The overall goal of Dr. Yankeelov&amp;#39;s research is to develop tumor forecasting methods by integrating advanced imaging technologies with predictive models of tumor growth to optimize therapy on a patient-specific basis. &amp;nbsp;This is accomplished by dividing his efforts into approximately equal parts mathematical modeling, pre-clinical development, and implementation in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;",

This review provides an overview of the current state of research on the hybrid, including its underlying theoretic model, its required electrodynamic coils, and a number of physics properties including confinement and stability properties. We discuss the potential advantages and challenges of this new concept, and highlight areas for future research.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;After completing her Fulbright year at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Sophia Henneberg earned her PhD at the University of York in 2016. Following her PhD, Dr. Henneberg became a leading expert in stellarator optimization. Among her notable research contributions, she developed an innovative stellarator-tokamak hybrid concept. In addition to her research, she currently serves as the principal investigator of the Stellarator Optimization TSVV group, a major European collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event details: &lt;/strong&gt;In-person seminars are only available to CU ID holders.

It has altered ways of knowing the public world by weakening epistemic authority, reinforcing epistemic suspicion and distrust, and eroding the foundations of a shared public world, contributing thereby to epistemic paralysis on the one hand and epistemic polarization on the other. Hyperconnectivity has altered regimes of public feeling by encouraging the expression and mobilization of moral outrage and thereby deepening partisan antipathy and affective polarization. And it has altered regimes of governing by enabling new modalities of algorithmic regulation, public and private.&amp;nbsp; The talk concludes by highlighting the tension between the technocratic premises and modalities of algorithmic governance and the populist regimes of digitally mediated knowing and feeling and by specifying how hyperconnectivity can promote both populism and its seeming antithesis, technocracy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers Brubaker&lt;/strong&gt; is Distinguished Professor of Sociology at UCLA, where he holds the UCLA Foundation Chair.&amp;nbsp; He has written widely on social theory, citizenship, nationalism, ethnicity, religion, gender, populism, and digital hyperconnectivity.

The chapters analyze such important topics as the postcolonial retrieval of the past, the deconstruction of post-Soviet visualities, representations of violence and atrocities in the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine, and the notion of art as a mechanism of civic resistance and identity-building. The book will be of interest to scholars of art history, Eastern European studies, cultural studies, decolonial studies, and postcolonial studies.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skulls, Sculptures and the Kaiser&amp;rsquo;s Museums: Global Entanglements, Colonial Race Science, and German Memory Culture (c. 1900-today)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What can museums tell us about a nation&amp;rsquo;s self-image? How does Germany approach its colonial past in light of the Holocaust? Berlin&amp;rsquo;s national museums have become the focus of current debates around repatriation and colonial collections &amp;ndash; most visibly those now housed inside the contested Humboldt Forum. But the Humboldt Forum is just the beginning.This talk moves beyond the ethnological collections inside the resurrected Prussian castle in the center of Berlin. It ties recent discussions to other, hitherto neglected sites, such as the seemingly unproblematic antiquity collections from the former Ottoman Empire on Berlin&amp;rsquo;s Museum Island, and collections of human remains from &amp;lsquo;German East Africa&amp;#39; held in the storage facilities on the city&amp;rsquo;s periphery. How were all these collections entangled not only with each other but also with global networks of trade, material extraction and exploitative labour? In the late nineteenth century, these collections were furthermore exploited to consolidate triumphalist narratives of &amp;#39;Western civilization&amp;#39; and human history &amp;ndash; not least by providing the raw materials for a new form of &amp;lsquo;scientific&amp;rsquo; antisemitism and racism that developed around 1900 onwards: with fatal consequences in the twentieth century. In spite of these problematic legacies, however, Berlin&amp;rsquo;s urban center still reflects an imperial mindset in the wake of an affirmative monumentalization of the Wilhelmine era. This tells us as much about race and memory politics in Germany today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following the lecture, Mirjam Brusius will be joined in conversation by Professor Avinoam Shalem,&amp;nbsp;Riggio Professor of the History of the Arts of Islam&amp;nbsp;(Columbia University).&amp;nbsp;A reception will conclude the evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to the public. Registration is required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mirjam S. Brusius&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a cultural historian with a PhD in the History and Philosophy of Science from the University of Cambridge and an MA from the Humboldt-Universit&amp;auml;t zu Berlin.&amp;nbsp;Currently, Mirjam is a&amp;nbsp;Research Fellow in Colonial and Global History&amp;nbsp;at the German Historical Institute London.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each year the annual&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;Lecture, presented by the Columbia Department of Germanic Languages, seeks to honor the legacy of the progressive&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;publishing house founded by Rudolf&amp;nbsp;Mosse, which helped to shape the democratic public sphere during the German Weimar Republic. Descendants of the&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;Family include Prof. George L&amp;nbsp;Mosse, the acclaimed historian of fascism, Dr. Hilde L.&amp;nbsp;Mosse, a distinguished child psychiatrist who worked with Harlem children suffering from reading disabilities, Hans Strauch, an accomplished architect, and Roger Strauch, a successful high technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Hans and Roger co-lead The&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;Foundation&amp;#39;s efforts to sustain and promote the&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;Family&amp;#39;s philanthropic legacy to support distinguished educational, research, health, and arts institutions and progressive causes.&lt;/p&gt;",

This inevitably led to great diversity in the lives of its inhabitants, shaping modern Ukraine into the multiethnic country it is today. Despite being subjected to different and conflicting power models during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Ukraine was not only imagined as a distinct entity with a unique culture and history but was also realized as a set of social and political institutions. The story of modern Ukraine is geopolitically complex, encompassing the historical narratives of several major communities &amp;ndash; including ethnic Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, and Russians &amp;ndash; who for centuries lived side by side.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bilenky will argue that there are a few key lessons we all can learn from studying Ukraine in the &amp;ldquo;long&amp;rdquo; nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;",

The Trump Administration announced the goal of ending the war within 100 days of inauguration, and diplomatic reengagement with Russia has already begun. What sort of peace agreement is feasible given the maximalist conditions set forth by Vladimir Putin, and the determination of Ukraine to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity? If the U.S. withdraws support from Ukraine, will Europe provide credible security guarantees? What are the implications for the European energy market and for global trade in oil and LNG? If sanctions are lifted, will international oil and gas companies reinvest in Russian upstream oil and gas? Will international service companies and equipment providers enable Russia to resume construction of LNG facilities and repair refineries damaged in the war?&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;This panel brings together Indigenous scholars to critically examine the historical and ongoing impacts of exploration, scientific research, and anthropology on Indigenous communities in Papua New Guinea and Hawai&amp;lsquo;i. Panelists will explore the intersections of Indigenous rights, data sovereignty, and the colonial legacies embedded within scientific knowledge production. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The panelists will reflect on how historical expeditions and research projects extracted knowledge, resources, and data from Indigenous lands and bodies, often without consent or reciprocity. They will interrogate the ways in which scientific and anthropological institutions have upheld colonial power structures, while also considering how Indigenous scholars and communities are reclaiming control over their knowledge and data. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through discussions of biocultural heritage, climate research, conservation, and food sovereignty, this panel will highlight efforts to establish ethical research frameworks that respect Indigenous sovereignty. Drawing from experiences in both New Guinea and Hawai&amp;lsquo;i, the panelists will address contemporary movements toward Indigenous-led research methodologies, legal protections, and data governance models that center Indigenous epistemologies and self-determination. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By placing these diverse yet interconnected histories and struggles in conversation, this panel challenges dominant narratives of scientific exploration and proposes pathways toward decolonial, community-centered knowledge practices that honor Indigenous rights, agency, and futures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://erm.yale.edu/people/hiilei-hobart\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Hi&amp;lsquo;ilei Hobart&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Ethnicity, Race, and Migration at Yale University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://anthropology.princeton.edu/people/ikaika-ramones\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Ikaika Ramones&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Princeton University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/nayahamui-rooney\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nayahamui Rooney&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Lecturer in Culture, History, and Language at Australian National University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.synchronicityearth.org/about-us/our-people/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Miriam Supuma&lt;/a&gt;, Programme Manager at Synchronicity Earth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/paige-west\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Paige West&lt;/a&gt;, Claire Tow Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/indigenous-sovereignty-in-science-and-data-registration-1228183222079\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

      "description": "DESIGN A UNIQUE DEGREE IN CUNY WITH CUNY BA – INFO SESSION [ONLINE]WHAT IS CUNY BACCALAUREATE (CUNY BA)?  \nCUNY BA is an Interdisciplinary Studies program that works within the CUNY college system. It has been around for over fifty years! CUNY BA is for students who want to design a bachelor’s degree (Area of Concentration|AOC) that is not already offered in CUNY.\nWhile CUNY BA does guide students with requirements, the program does not tell students what to study. Students should know what areas they want to pursue. As part of the CUNY BA application, students propose what they want to study and what CUNY courses they think are suitable for the bachelor’s degree they are creating (it’s a first draft).\nCUNY BA students take courses in the CUNY departments and/or colleges to fulfill the AOC requirements. So, students will have to be enrolled in a CUNY college to be part of CUNY BA program (that will be the student’s home college).  Students will need to be accepted into a CUNY college for the Summer or Fall 2025 semester. Students can start the CUNY college application and the CUNY BA Program application at the same time, as they are different applications that go to separate places. The student searches the CUNY catalogs for courses that are suitable for their Area of Concentration (AOC). The courses listed in the AOC must be from CUNY’s four-year colleges (not community colleges).\nCUNY BA  information sessions give an overview of the program and the application process. This includes: \n\nbenefits of the CUNY BA program\n\ntransferring up to 90 credits\nstudying at different CUNY departments and colleges\nstudents can start at a CUNY Community College (2-year college)\n\n\nCUNY BA application process (no fee to apply).\ntips on finding CUNY courses for your Area of Concentration (AOC; CUNY BA's version of a major)\nstudents propose what they want to study in the CUNY BA Application (Name and list of courses)\nThe Role of the CUNY BA Faculty Mentor\nQuestion and answer session at the end\n\n#CUNYBA\nThese are the admissions criteria to apply to CUNY BA.\nUPCOMING CUNY BA INFO SESSION DATES (LIVE ONLINE VIA ZOOM): \n\nMonday, February 24th, 2025 at 5 PM\nWednesday, March 5th, 2025 at 12:30 PM\nTuesday, March 25th, 2025 at 3 PM\n\n \nFind us online: \nCUNY BA Website: https://cunyba.cuny.edu\nCUNY BA LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/school/cunybac\nCUNY BA Facebook: https://facebook.com/cunybac\nCUNY BA Instagram: https://instagram.com/cunybac\n \n \n\nDate:\nMarch 5, 2025\nTime:\n12:30 PM — 1:30 PM\nCollege:\nCUNY Baccalaureate for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies\nAddress:\nONLINE\nPhone:\n2128178220\nAdmission:\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://cunyba.cuny.edu/prospective-students/informationsessions/",

      "description": "Mathematics Colloquium: Invariants of Words from Random Group ElementsProfessor Doron Puder(Tel Aviv University)\nAbstract\nLet w be a word in a free group and let G be a finite group (or more generally, a compact group). A w-random element of G is obtained by substituting the letters of w with uniform random elements from G. For example, if w=xyxy^{-2}, the random element is ghg^{-2}, with g and h independent random elements of G. In a series of works with various coauthors, we discovered that in nice families of groups, such as the symmetric groups or the unitary groups, some very interesting invariants of the word w can be extracted from w-random elements.\nNote: This story involves probability, topology, algebra, combinatorics and representation theory. In the talk, which is aimed at graduate students, I will try to give a flavor of these interesting phenomena.\n\nDate:\nMarch 6, 2025\nTime:\n12:30 PM — 1:30 PM\nCollege:\nThe City College of New York\nAddress:\nThe City College of NY 160 Convent Avenue New York, NY 10031\nManhattan\nBuilding:\nThe North Academic Center (NAC) Room: 6/115\nPhone:\n(212)650-5346\nAdmission:\nFree\nWebsite:\nhttps://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/seminar/mathematics-colloquium/talk/247/",

Emerging economies, such as Bangladesh, exemplify how collaborative frameworks and resource-sharing between developing nations can accelerate AI adoption in governance. The application of AI technology in administrative processes, particularly in bridging institutional voids and leveraging complementary asset portfolios, promises to revolutionize the efficiency and efficacy of governance complementary asset portfolios, promises to revolutionize the efficiency and efficacy of governance systems. This panel explores the potential of AI to drive sustainable development and enhance public service delivery by addressing the gaps within governance structures often caused by institutional voids—scenarios where formal institutions are weak or absent. This exploration highlights Bangladesh and other developing nations that are leveraging South-South cooperation to share AI-driven solutions and strategies for overcoming governance challenges. By integrating AI into governance, these countries can address institutional voids more effectively, building adaptive, responsive systems even in regions with fragile institutions. ",

      "description": "Lens of Impact - Exploring the Cross-cultural Spaces of Art and Design Discourse is a discursive format aiming at bringing together differently situated perspectives to foster a platform for exploring, discussing and informing about the different lenses through which design practices are perceived and performed within the contexts of Switzerland and the United States. Organized jointly by the School of Art and Design History and Theory (ADHT) of Parsons School of Design at The New School and Swissnex, this regular event connects two distinguished speakers who share their viewpoints and explore the translation between them. Following these dialogues, an open Q&A session invites both Parsons' students and the broader Swissnex audience to join the cross-cultural exchange. Facilitating translation between Switzerland and the US, the series delves into the local political, social, and cultural landscapes that shape design practices and academic discourse. Embracing topics such as queering design, migrating design, and the more-than-human approach to design, Lens of Impact endeavors to provoke thought, inspire innovation, and foster understanding. After a successful first three editions in 2024, the series will now return in 2025.The first iteration of the 2025 Lens of Impact series, Tailoring Freedom, brings together Dr. Jonathan Michael Square, Assistant Professor of Black Visual Culture at Parsons School of Design, and Sasha Huber, a Swiss-Haitian visual artist-researcher based in Helsinki. This event explores the intersections of self-fashioning, visual culture, and historical accountability. For over a decade, Sasha Huber has engaged in reparative artistic interventions, notably through her involvement in Demounting Louis Agassiz, a campaign initiated in 2007 by Swiss historian and activist Hans Fässler, which critically reassesses the Swiss-born scientist’s legacy, including his role in promoting ‘scientific’ racism. Dr. Jonathan Square's work focuses on fashion and visual culture of the African Diaspora, notably also the history of enslavement through a fashion lens. He recently curated the exhibition Revolisyon Toupatou at the New School, which shines a light on the role of fashion and textile arts in narrating Haitian history and identity. Together, Square and Huber will discuss the mutual Haitian connections in their work, reflecting on how historical narratives are woven into identity and artistic expression. Their exchange will illuminate the ways in which art and research can challenge dominant histories and offer new perspectives on the enduring legacies of colonialism, resistance and accountability.",

      "description": "A uniquely broad and fair-minded guide to making immigration policy ethical. Immigration is now a polarizing issue across most advanced democracies. But too much that is written about immigration fails to appreciate the complex responses to the phenomenon. Too many observers assume imaginary consensus, avoid basic questions, or disregard the larger context for human migration. In Borders and Belonging, Hiroshi Motomura offers a complex and fair-minded account of immigration, its root causes, and the varying responses to it. Taking stock of the issue's complexity, while giving credence to the opinions of immigration critics, he tackles a series of important questions that, when answered, will move us closer to a more realistic and sustainable immigration policy.",

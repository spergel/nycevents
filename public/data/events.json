      "description": "https://lu.ma/43m8iiy5\n\n‚ÄãThe cabbage Salon is a space for curious minds, deep discussions, and unexpected connections. Each gathering brings people together to engage with big ideas‚Äîguided by a speaker, and shaped by the thoughts, experiences, and perspectives of everyone in the room.\n\n‚ÄãNo academic background required‚Äîjust a willingness to think, share, and listen.\n\n‚ÄãThis salon is inspired by the texts of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Thomas Nagel, Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, and Robert Nozick.*\n\n‚ÄãThe Self‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄãWe take for granted that each of us has a self‚Äîan ‚ÄúI.‚Äù The ‚ÄúI‚Äù in ‚ÄúI see the tree‚Äù or ‚ÄúI like this band.‚Äù But if we take a closer look, the ‚ÄúI‚Äù, that we are, becomes strangely elusive: If we try to focus on our pure ‚ÄúI‚Äù‚Äîstripped of any thought beyond the self-aware ‚ÄúI‚Äù‚Äîit slips from our grasp. The closer we try to get to it, the further it moves away. Trippy! What can we learn from philosophy about the nature of the self?\n\n‚Äã...and Other Drgs**\n\n‚ÄãWhat are we seeking when we take mind-altering substances? The list of possible answers is long: self-improvement, self-destruction, self-purification... Do we seek liberation, community, chaos, or the unknown? None of the above? And what if there were a drg‚Äîinexpensive, free from side effects‚Äîthat simply made us happier? Should we take it? Why‚Äîor why not? \n\n‚ÄãPresented By:\n\n‚ÄãGeorg Spoo, PhD. is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy, who practiced his Postdoc at Columbia University. His academic research focus is on epistemology, social and political philosophy, and existentialism. He currently consults with companies to incorporate philosophical ideas into the practical business world. Teams have benefitted from Georg‚Äôs discussions on the philosophy of decision-making so they‚Äôre equipped to make better ones. At the heart of Georg‚Äôs beliefs is that everyone should live in peace, and no one should have to suffer inequality.\n\n‚ÄãHow We Do Things:\n\n‚Äãüîπ Warm-Up: We start with a short icebreaker to get minds moving and ideas flowing.\nüîπ Talk & Discussion: Our guest speaker introduces the theme, sharing insights and questions to consider.\nüîπ Group Conversations: Attendees break into small groups to explore the topic, bringing their own ideas and experiences into the mix.\nüîπ More Talk, More Conversation: Our speaker presents a second round of thoughts, deepening the discussion before another round of open dialogue.\nüîπ Final Thoughts & Closing: We wrap up with reflections, takeaways, and an open floor for last thoughts.\n\n‚ÄãThis is not a lecture‚Äîit‚Äôs a conversation. Bring your point of view, your questions, and your curiosity. Get weird, get controversial, get real, baby. \n\n‚ÄãCome for the ideas, stay for the drinks, lovers, and friends. üç∑\n\n‚Äã*If you'd like to dig deeper on these texts, it is absolutely not required and you won't feel lost if you haven't. But we've put them together for you here, anyways.\n\n‚Äã**idk what the rules of the Internet are these days please don't clown us for censoring\n\n‚Äã***Seating is limited, so first come first serve. But standing is good for you, someone said somewhere once.\n\n‚Äã****If cost is an issue, please reach out @cabbagehousekids, everyone is welcome!",

And Ikebana‚Äîthe traditional Japanese art of flower arranging‚Äîallows us to play with movement, texture, and shape in order to create botanical sculptures. In this Gather, we‚Äôll use farm fresh flowers, dried foliage, minimal ingredients, and simple mechanics to create two Ikebana designs. One design will be in a provided Ikebana vessel, and the other will be done in a vessel we‚Äôve each brought with us. We‚Äôll learn to attach flower frogs and explore different design approaches. We‚Äôll then celebrate each others‚Äô art pieces while enjoying light snacks and conversation.",

This kind of encounter can often happen when we approach a sketchbook with an attitude of play‚Äîwith a new tool or a new way of moving the hand across the surface of the paper. In this Gather, we‚Äôll explore how we make marks on a surface‚Äîlike stamping with ink, drawing with a comb, and painting on yupo paper. We will experiment with these tools to create our own unique and unexpected textures. This can open up a new vocabulary of textures to apply to our creative practices across any medium.",

The best place to watch is from the area around St. Patrick's Cathedral; better yet, bring your bonnet and join the parade.",

While these demographic shifts pose potential challenges, they may also present opportunities for families, workplaces, and communities, particularly if older adults remain healthy and socially engaged. Research on age-related changes in prosocial tendencies&amp;mdash;behaviors that benefit others, such as helping and charitable giving&amp;mdash;points to encouraging possibilities of an aging population. In this talk, I review recent findings on the association between age and prosociality, including helping behaviors, volunteering, and charitable giving. I also discuss my ongoing work on older and younger adults&amp;rsquo; daily helping behavior and its links to emotions and meaning in life, as well as strategies to promote prosocial engagement across the adult life span. Together, these findings highlight the potential of older adulthood as a period of enriched social contribution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

We consider an economy where banks have market power in lending and privately monitor loans, which reduces their probabilities of default. We show that lower safe rates lead to lower margins and higher risk-taking when banks have low market power, but the result is reversed for high market power. We show that the reversal is stronger when deposits are insured, and it is robust to introducing market power in deposits and endogenous bank leverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that an RSVP is required to attend this event.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Please click&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeS7DFdhFv-sMN1_Vx6F65c_Jv1L_G51tbwpU4Y1FRHo7Rwgg/viewform?usp=header\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to RSVP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light refreshments will be served.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Information for the first lecture in the course series (on 2/25/25) can be found&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://events.columbia.edu/cal/event/eventView.do?b=de&amp;amp;calPath=/public/cals/MainCal&amp;amp;guid=CAL-00bbdb7c-94da89fa-0194-dcf83425-0000103cevents@columbia.edu&amp;amp;recurrenceId=\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

Wisdom is a complex personality trait comprised of empathy/compassion, emotional regulation, self-reflection, acceptance of diverse perspectives, and spirituality. Putative neurobiological underpinnings of wisdom involve prefrontal cortex and limbic striatum, and they provide a biological basis for enhancement of wisdom components with healthy aging. A number of randomized controlled trials have shown an increase in emotional regulation, empathy/compassion, and spirituality with behavioral interventions with moderate to large effect sizes. Our studies show a strong inverse association between wisdom and loneliness, and suggest that wisdom, especially its compassion component, can potentially be an antidote for the modern behavioral pandemic of loneliness, suicides, and opioid-related deaths of despair. I will discuss some exciting frontiers for future research on wisdom including global psycho-bio-social approaches as well as technological advances to help move artificial intelligence (AI) to artificial wisdom (AW).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Nothing demonstrates the phenomenon better than a unique military organ of political officers &amp;ndash; a directorate in the Ministry of Defense, replicas of which have been emerging in other parts of the Russian strategic community. This organ, which consists of political officers, priests and psychologists, is charged with maintaining the loyal minds, motivated hearts and stable psychology of Russian servicemen and citizens. How, why and when did this interplay of the politics, church, military, and ideology that this organ exemplifies, emerge? What are its implications for the future of the Russian political course, national elite, and military aristocracy? To explain the sources, essence and consequences of this phenomenon, &amp;quot;The New Commissars&amp;quot; embarks on a journey through Russian strategic culture, political mentality, ideology, civil-military and state-church relations before, during and following the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;The past ten years have seen an outpouring of research on the rise (or return) of politics varyingly described as authoritarian, illiberal, right-wing populist, post-neoliberal, extremist or even fascist around the world. Many commentators assign technology a key causal role. Echoing the origins of media and communications studies in crowd psychology and propaganda analysis, they argue that the affordances of search and social media platforms undermine both individual rationality and democratic deliberation. This talk takes up the subject of platforms and contemporary politics from a different angle. Spurred by a sense that tech critique has been &amp;#39;running out of steam,&amp;#39; Moira Weigel turns to a new analytic site and approach. Specifically, she shares findings from four years of research on e-commerce entrepreneurs, conducted in both the United States and China. Adapting methods from science and technology studies, she shows that these platforms bring a variety of actors into new &amp;ldquo;configurations,&amp;rdquo; which analyses based on received demographic categories fail to explain. Situating platform entrepreneurship in centuries of petty capitalism, as well as more recent organizational forms like franchising and direct marketing, she argues that platforms both reflect and reinforce processes of disintermediation that go beyond &amp;ldquo;content.&amp;rdquo; This disintermediation creates opportunities for individuals excluded from prior institutions and arrangements insofar as they are willing to accept certain, centralizing protocols&amp;ndash;fostering political forms that seem both atavistic and futuristic, regressive and disruptive, at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://complit.fas.harvard.edu/people/moira-weigel/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Moira Weigel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;writes and teaches about the history, theory, and social life of media and communication technologies, from the early nineteenth century to the present. She originally trained in comparative literature and film studies, working in German, French, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. More recently, she has focused on data-driven technologies, particularly social media and marketplace platforms, as well as on new developments in artificial intelligence and machine translation. Her articles on these subjects have appeared or are forthcoming in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;boundary 2, The International Journal of Communication, New Media&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Society, Polity, and Social Media + Society&lt;/em&gt;.

Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/christopher-caes/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christopher Caes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sixty-four poems in &amp;quot;A Calligraphy of Days&amp;quot; reflect Krzysztof Siwczyk&amp;rsquo;s wide-ranging and variegated style. Born in 1977, Siwczyk has lived most of his life in the Silesian city of Gliwice. In 1995, he became a wunderkind of the Polish poetry scene with his debut volume Wild Kids, an edgy and unsentimental narrative of youthful tribulations and urban malaise during Poland&amp;rsquo;s transition from communism to capitalism. Siwczyk&amp;rsquo;s poems careen down the page at great speed, relying on clever turns of phrase or an idea that illuminates a larger meaning. As in calligraphy, a meandering subterranean process connects meaning and memory, thought and verse. Teased to the surface, words and images emerge in rapid, terse, and precise bursts. Throughout his career, Siwczyk has never ceased to challenge our sense of who we are&amp;mdash;changing course multiple times in the process. Following several volumes full of expansive lines, his most recent works offer spare meditations on illness and grief. Clipped and understated, these post-Holocaust poems address our inability to speak of death and tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;",

Anna Hidalgo argues that these relationships reflect a broader phenomenon in which fantasy becomes a means of coping with constrained and seemingly meaningless lives. Fantasy, she suggests, provides the economic, symbolic, and erotic imaginaries that help individuals recover meaning and persist. Drawing from her current book project, Hidalgo integrates perspectives from cultural and economic sociology, as well as gender, sexuality, and queer studies, to demonstrate how people imagine alternative futures that allow them to transcend their everyday realities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anna Hidalgo&lt;/strong&gt; is a Provost&amp;rsquo;s Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Sociology at New York University. She is an ethnographer and qualitative sociologist studying culture, sexuality, gender, and race. Anna is currently working on a book manuscript which examines transnational intimate relationships in a Peruvian coastal town. She examines masculine subcultures, tourism and escapism, and how fantasy functions as a way for people to manage and resist the socially and structurally constrained conditions that they experience in everyday life. A new project focuses on the experiences of Venezuelan asylum seekers in New York City. Her work has been funded by the Ford Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the Social Sciences Research Council, and the American Association for University Women, among others. Anna received her PhD in Sociology from Columbia University and her BA in History from Brown University. She was born in the Dominican Republic, and was raised in South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0vdOChqDIoHN0qYQw3Rut5mAsOts4yIY4S\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register to attend via Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

Those with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, or other neurodivergent experiences often have to conform to a society that was inherently built to disadvantage the way they exist in the world. In this presentation we will begin scratching the surface on the challenges neurodivergent individuals face within a capitalist system, including workplace accommodations, societal biases, and economic disparities. We will discuss the potential benefits of neurodiversity in fostering innovation and creativity, while also shedding light on the urgency of dismantling ableist structures to create inclusive and equitable institutions that value diverse cognitive perspectives. We will end with some tips and suggestions on how to support our neurodivergent students and peers.&lt;/p&gt;",

The upheaval sparked waves of dispossession that rapidly moved beyond the seizure of factories and farms from industrialists and landowners, envisioned by Bolshevik revolutionaries, to penetrate the bedrock of social life: the spaces where people lived. In Power and Possession in the Russian Revolution, Anne O&amp;rsquo;Donnell reimagines the Bolsheviks&amp;rsquo; unprecedented effort to eradicate private property and to create a new political economy&amp;mdash;socialism&amp;mdash;to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Donnell&amp;rsquo;s account captures the story of property in reverse, showing how the bonds connecting people to their things were broken and how new ways of knowing things, valuing them, and possessing them coalesced amid the political ferment and economic disarray of the Revolution. O&amp;rsquo;Donnell reminds us that Russia&amp;rsquo;s postrevolutionary confiscation of property, like many other episodes of mass dispossession in the twentieth century, largely escaped traditional forms of record keeping. She repairs this omission, drawing on sources that chronicle the lived experience of upheaval&amp;mdash;popular petitions, apartment inspections, internal audits of revolutionary institutions, and records of the political police&amp;mdash;to reconstruct an archive of dispossession. The result is an unusually intimate history of the Bolsheviks&amp;rsquo; attempts to conquer people and things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Bolsheviks&amp;rsquo; reimagining of property not only changed peoples&amp;rsquo; lives and destinies, it formed the foundation of a new type of state&amp;mdash;one that eschewed the defense of private property rights in favor of an enduring but enigmatic new domain: socialist state property.&lt;/p&gt;",

This talk, titled &amp;ldquo;Turning Holocaust Slang into Art: Between K. Tzetnik and Chava Rosenfarb,&amp;rdquo; will take place virtually via Zoom.&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Yiddish language drastically changed in the ghettos and camps of Nazi Europe. By one estimate, roughly 3,000 new words and phrases were added to the language. Many of these neologisms were of a vulgar nature, relating to topics like theft and sex work. While some people found these new words embarrassing, unseemly and just plain ugly, others attempted to uplift them and transform them into art. Among the writers that incorporated Khurbn Yiddish (Yiddish of the Holocaust), into their postwar poetry and prose, the authors K. Tzetnik and Chava Rosenfarb stand out. Each extracted and presented the aesthetic potential of Khurbn Yiddish words in different ways.&amp;nbsp; K. Tzetnik emphasized the horrifying, bizarre side of Khurbn Yiddish words, molding them into an expressionistic scream. Rosenfarb, by contrast, shined a light onto the small acts of resilience contained within Khurbn Yiddish words, memories of self-expression and communication against the odds. Her ghetto terms become beautiful in the way they invite readers into scenes of everyday life under Nazi rule, moments from the margins of history that are rarely considered worthy of notice. The two authors also clash on the topic of female sexuality&amp;mdash;and the ways that words relate to the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah Pollin-Galay&lt;/strong&gt; is Associate Professor in the Department of Literature at Tel Aviv University, where she is also Head of the&lt;a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://humanities.tau.ac.il/goldreich/&amp;amp;data=05%257C02%257Ceuropean.studies@yale.edu%257C811ae3e29fa74d42ac6a08dcc7932810%257Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%257C0%257C0%257C638604682069162377%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=%257C0%257C%257C%257C&amp;amp;sdata=5YzqhiVPVL+l+/lV1WaMvKM0Fpa0eJE+RSQSFIE3XJ0=&amp;amp;reserved=0\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en-humanities.tau.ac.il/goldreich\"&gt;Jona Goldrich Institute for Yiddish Language, Literature and Culture&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;In addition to being a 2024-2025 Senior Scholar at the Fortunoff Archive for Holocaust Testimony at Yale University, Pollin-Galay is also a Yiddish Book Center Translation Fellow, where she is translating Yiddish ecopoetry from the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-2025-kadar-lecture-with-hannah-pollin-galay-tickets-1109404983169?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;CLICK HERE TO REGISTER FOR THIS EVENT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supported by the generosity of the Naomi Foundation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naomi Prawer Kadar Annual Memorial Lecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; provides an opportunity for the public to explore topics of Yiddish language and linguistics, the history of Yiddish, Yiddish children&amp;rsquo;s literature and education.

Like the rest of Ukraine, the Black Sea peninsula has long been an object of imperial desire. It has served as an exotic showcase of Russian and Soviet power; it has been presented as a Shangri-La of mountainous coasts and warm water beaches. But behind Crimea&amp;#39;s postcard image lie much deeper and darker realities of demography, history and geography that Russia has anxiously tried to conceal and erase for centuries. One of them is the Crimea of the Crimean Tatars, who are recognized as an indigenous people of Ukraine. In this lecture, Rory Finnin explores the literature and culture of this Crimea hidden from our view, paying special attention to key Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian writers determined to open our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;This talk by Stephen Casper explores the entangled problem of representing movement and impact through a cultural and scientific genealogy of traumatic brain injury, violence, acceleration culture, and the rise of the biomechanical approach to trauma. Anchoring this exploration is the lucite calvarium&amp;mdash;a transparent skull cap used in experiments on a monkey to observe brain injuries&amp;mdash;which serves as the focal point for this cultural history.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the Futurists&amp;#39; avant-garde celebration of speed and mechanical violence, Casper examines how their artistic glorification of acceleration shaped public imaginaries and technological aesthetics, inadvertently influencing scientific framings of trauma. Andy Warhol&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Death in America&lt;/em&gt; series provides a mid-century lens on how violent collisions&amp;mdash;whether from car crashes or interpersonal brutality&amp;mdash;captured the ethos of acceleration while reflecting the disturbing realities of head injury.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The artists were onto something. Scientists grappling with the physics of deceleration faced similar challenges in visualizing the invisible forces of trauma&amp;mdash;a task often reliant on artistic metaphors and representations. The lucite calvarium, with its translucent mapping of brain tissue deformation, emerges as a bridge between art and science, offering not only a tool for experimental insight but also an artifact of aesthetic and intellectual synthesis.

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;Children and young adults with medical complexity experience a myriad of risk factors for decreased bone mineral density and fragility-related fractures. Despite this known vulnerability, the true incidence of fragility-related fractures in this population is not well documented. Furthermore, there is no clear medical consensus about how best to mitigate this risk. Family and caregivers of individuals with medical complexity often experience unfair scrutiny, stigma, and reputational risk when fragility-related fractures occur.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our talk will attempt to provide an evidence-based estimate of the incidence of fragility-related fractures. It will first define what is meant by the term &amp;ldquo;medical complexity.&amp;rdquo; It will then offer a brief review of bone health and metabolism and review the risk fractures associated with decreased bone mineral density in the medically fragile population. We will also review current evidence-based recommendations for evaluation of decreased bone mineral density and mitigation of fracture risk. Lastly, our talk will propose a new language model that reframes our conversations about fragility-related fractures, shifting away from a punitive model of cause and effect, and toward a recognition that decreased bone mineral density and heightened fracture risk are known complications of chronic medically complex diseases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alvin Moyer, MD,&amp;nbsp;Chief Medical Officer,&amp;nbsp;Director of Palliative Care Services,&amp;nbsp;Elizabeth Seton Children&amp;rsquo;s Center&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cemre Robinson, MD, Director, Pediatric Bone Health Program, Mount Sinai&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weinberg Family Cerebral Palsy Center Orthopedics Lunch &amp;amp; Learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=\"https://www.weinberg.cuimc.columbia.edu/education/videos-webinars/cp-orthopedics-lunch-learn-seminar-series\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Cerebral Palsy Lunch &amp;amp; Learn seminar series&lt;/a&gt; focuses on the care of cerebral palsy across the&amp;nbsp;lifespan.&amp;nbsp;The series is designed to improve cerebral palsy care by providing participants and faculty a forum for interaction and collaboration.

The demand for qualified magnetic fusion technology personnel has grown so rapidly that it far outpaces the development of the workforce needed to support this nascent industry. This has led several start-ups to partner with existing, DOE-supported fusion laboratories to access the expertise required to achieve their goals. We propose this Fusion Innovation Research Engine (FIRE) consortium in Fusion Superconducting Magnet Technologies as a broad-based means to formally address existing gaps in the commercial fusion realm. We propose to pursue basic fusion magnet technologies applicable to a wide range of fusion devices, not just one device or concept, and to make those freely available to the community. Technology for high-field magnetic confinement fusion devices has thus far focused almost entirely on REBCO. While REBCO is a marvelous conductor with extremely high current density at high magnetic fields, it is not ideal for all applications, not the least because of its high cost and complex processing. REBCO is available only in tape form, resulting in high magnetization (screening current) loss in rapidly changing magnetic fields as well as highly non-uniform stress distribution. Not every fusion concept needs the high-field capability of REBCO. Several fusion start-ups we&amp;rsquo;ve engaged are pursuing lower-field, lower-cost alternatives for which MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Bi-2212 or even Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn could potentially be better options if sufficient information regarding suitability were more widely available. Based on feedback from industry we intend to advance not only high field REBCO but also these promising, but lesser-studied options as part of our developmental activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event details: &lt;/strong&gt;In-person seminars are only available to CU ID holders. At this time, Non-Columbia affiliates and the general public are only invited to participate remotely. Contact cr2090@columbia.edu if you would like the Zoom link for this seminar.&lt;/p&gt;",

Against common framings of queer politics as either a progressive campaign for state recognition or as a subcultural rejection of prevailing gender norms, it provides an alternative view of queer radicalism that clarifies its true scale. Revisiting the gay liberation movement, Black lesbian feminism, and AIDS activism, it explores the relationship between struggles for sexual freedom and questions of capital accumulation, empire, and state violence. The queer radical tradition is shown to have not only conditioned the trajectory of LGBTI history, but also to have radicalized wider anti-imperialist, socialist, and abolitionist struggles past and present.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr.&amp;nbsp;Alex Stoffel is an Assistant Professor&amp;nbsp;in International Politics at Queen Mary University of London. His research takes up critical questions regarding the intersections of sexuality, race, and desire within capitalist expansion.

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;Credit impacts many aspects of everyday life in the US. Your ability to access financial products and services, housing, and even cell phone or internet service can be influenced by your credit score. In spite of that fact, or perhaps because of it, understanding the credit system can feel confusing and overwhelming. What factors determine your credit score? How can you improve your credit score, and what rights do you have to dispute your credit report?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this webinar a TrustPlus financial coach will answer these questions and provide tips for managing your credit score as part of an overall personal financial plan.&lt;/p&gt;",

This Practice Teaching session (formerly known as &amp;ldquo;Microteaching&amp;rdquo;) will pair you with a trained peer facilitator and a group of 3-4 other graduate students. Together, you and your fellow participants will take turns delivering short (&amp;lt;10 min.) samples of instruction to each other. After each teaching sample, your facilitator and your peers will offer structured feedback to support your teaching. Whether you are currently teaching at Columbia or not, all graduate students looking to practice teaching are welcome to attend this Practice Teaching session.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some teaching skills you could practice at this session include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Introducing new content, concepts, or skills to students (i.e., an engaging mini-lecture)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Testing new and varied modes of student engagement to boost participation and inclusivity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using of visuals (blackboard, whiteboard, slide decks, handouts, etc.) to bolster learning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Facilitating discussion (i.e., posing discussion questions, monitoring student engagement, attention, and learning, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Participants should determine which skill they wish to focus on and come prepared with something to teach their peers in an active and engaging way. Registrants will be provided additional guidance to help prepare for Practice Teaching in the week prior to the session.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Practice Teaching sessions are facilitated by CTL&amp;#39;s trained graduate student Teaching Consultants.

Jackson Women&amp;rsquo;s Health Organization&lt;/em&gt; decision in June 2022 removed federal protections for the right to abortion, fundamentally changing the abortion landscape in the United States.

Drawing from vital statistics and US Census Bureau data from 2012 through 2023 for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, this study uses a Bayesian panel data model to evaluate state-by-subgroup specific changes in fertility and infant mortality associated with complete or 6-week abortion bans in 14 US states.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suzanne Bell&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

This is a hybrid event, you may attend &lt;strong&gt;in-person at 617 Kent Hall&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;virtually via Zoom&lt;/strong&gt;. Please register using the appropriate link below.&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Modern German Jewish thinkers often addressed the question of the role of mediation in understanding the divine and the world through the lens of the Second Commandment&amp;#39;s prohibition on graven images. Philosophers like Moses Mendelssohn and Hermann Cohen approached visual mediation with suspicion, arguing that images could obstruct a true encounter with God and truth, potentially leading to idolatry. This presentation introduces the Prague born media theorist Vil&amp;eacute;m Flusser (1920-1991) as a Jewish philosopher, and examines his contribution to this discussion. Flusser argues that digital images are different from &amp;ldquo;traditional images&amp;rdquo; as they do not reflect or distort reality but generate visual entities entirely independent of the physical world. Understood as such, the digital image is not an intermediary and therefore escapes standard theological problems associated with idolatry and mediation. By positioning Flusser within the German Jewish tradition, this presentation brings to the fore a neglected voice in 20th-century Jewish philosophy and explores the applicability of traditional questions to our digital age.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ido Ben Harush&lt;/strong&gt; is a PhD candidate in the department of Germanic Languages and Literatures at Yale University. He is a scholar of modern German Jewish philosophy and literature, with interest in theories of image, gesture and secularization. His dissertation examines the literary variations and afterlives of the prohibition of idolatry and the biblical ban on images (&lt;em&gt;Bilderverbot&lt;/em&gt;) in the work of modern German Jewish authors and shows how concerns about idolatry are retrieved and repurposed in philosophical, political, and aesthetic discourses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-ban-on-images-goes-digital-vilem-flusser-and-german-jewish-thought-tickets-1109489495949?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;REGISTER TO ATTEND IN-PERSON&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-ban-on-images-goes-digital-with-ido-ben-harush-virtual-tickets-1109497740609?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;REGISTER TO ATTEND VIRTUALLY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supported by the generosity of the Radov and Kaye families.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While all IIJS events are free and open to the public, we do encourage a suggested &lt;a href=\"https://www.givenow.columbia.edu/?_sa=05376&amp;amp;_sd=386#\"&gt;donation&lt;/a&gt; of $10.&lt;/p&gt;",

The monthly seminars take place on the second Wednesday of the month, 2:00-3:00 PM EST. The presentations are open to the Columbia community (in person and online) and to researchers outside Columbia (via Zoom).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, March 12th (2:00 PM ET)&lt;/strong&gt;, IICD welcomes Le Cong, Assistant Professor of Pathology and of Genetics, Stanford University. Seminar hosted by Jellert Gaublomme. The seminar will take place in person in Schermerhorn Hall 603 (Morningside Heights campus).

This talk will present our development of machine learning-optimized CRISPR tools that enable simultaneous perturbation and lineage tracing at unprecedented precision. Using melanoma as a model system, we have leveraged these tools to uncover mechanisms of drug resistance and immune evasion. Specifically, our work reveals how EZH2 and other epigenetic regulators influence melanoma evolution. Additionally, I will discuss our recent work in tracking natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor killing through multi-omics approaches and the development of CRISPR-GPT, an AI-powered platform for automated genome engineering. These integrated technologies provide new insights into cancer-immune interactions and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for overcoming treatment resistance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Le Cong is an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Pathology and Genetics at Stanford. His lab pioneers scalable gene-editing and gene insertion technologies for gene and cell therapy by integrating insights from metagenomics, computational biology, and high-throughput engineering. Leveraging single-cell functional screening and multi-omics approaches, his group elucidates the molecular mechanisms underpinning cancer and immunological diseases. Recently, they have focused on harnessing AI and machine learning to design and evolve gene-editing proteins and RNAs, thereby accelerating the discovery of druggable targets for immune therapeutics across cancer and other human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibly via Zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;In protest of Israel&amp;rsquo;s war on Gaza, students across Western campuses built encampments and called to end the role of their own universities in Palestinian unfreedom. This student movement instigated renewed debates about the imbrication of higher education with imperial violence. Among the student demands, the call to sever ties with Israeli universities sparked considerable institutional opposition. Western university administrators consistently refused to engage the demand, while their Israeli counterparts staged repeated interventions to intercept it. This talk reads the negotiation processes between student organizers and administrators to interrogate how university complicity in violence is constituted as unspeakable. Tracing colonial entanglements across Israeli, European, and North American universities, this talk will show how academic bureaucracy and discourse form an epistemic counterinsurgency against the movement for Palestinian liberation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.mayaywind.com/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maya Wind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a President&amp;rsquo;s and Andrew W.

Southern Iran. The people of Abadan have been fighting an Iraqi siege.

But how can you resist in a war without taking up arms?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then Omid finds an abandoned ship in Abadan&amp;rsquo;s harbor.

Born in Iran, she left the country in 1984 to study mathematics in Paris but soon shifted her focus to the visual arts, beginning with photography before transitioning to filmmaking. Farsi&amp;#39;s films, celebrated for their bold storytelling, have consistently challenged the Iranian regime. Since 2009, she has been unable to return to Iran due to her activism and the critical nature of her work. All of her films remain banned in the country. In February 2023, her first animated feature, &lt;em&gt;The Siren (La Sir&amp;egrave;ne)&lt;/em&gt;, premiered as the opening film of the Panorama section at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival. The film later won Best Animated Film at the 16th Asia Pacific Screen Awards in Gold Coast, Australia, in November 2023.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Aubrey Gabel&lt;/strong&gt; is Assistant Professor of French at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced by Maison Fran&amp;ccedil;aise and co-sponsored by the MESAAS and Middle East Institute at Columbia University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Singers and composers were dedicated to the beauty of melody and emphasized the long, sustained line of the music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This program features music for solo piano that exemplifies the essence of the bel canto style. Schubert (whose&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;An Die Musik&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the inspiration for David Del Tredici&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ode to Music&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;composed songs that transformed the art of songwriting.&amp;nbsp;Mozart produced some of the great operas of all time and infused his instrumental works with his brilliant sense of drama and lyricism. Bellini was one of the great bel canto composers and had a profound influence on nineteenth century piano music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The art of transcription flourished in the nineteenth century and continues to this day, creating an entire repertoire inspired by music not originally composed for the piano, many based on works in the bel canto style.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ABOUT THE PERFORMER&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An adventurous and inquisitive musician, pianist&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Marc Peloquin&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;excels in making connections with his audience as a performer and advocate of the music of our time. His performances have been described by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;as &amp;ldquo;refreshing and alive&amp;rdquo; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Time Out New York&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;declared Marc an &amp;ldquo;innovative ivory tickler.&amp;rdquo; His recordings can be heard on the Albany, C.R.I., Naxos, and Urtext labels. Marc also has a passion for writing piano transcriptions, some of which are published by Boosey and Hawkes and Theodore Presser.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Marc is a Resident Teaching Artist at the Bloomingdale School of Music in New York City and curator of the Faculty Concert Series. He is a former faculty member of The New School where he created innovative music courses in the department of Humanities. He received his Doctor of Musical Arts degree from The Manhattan School of Music with additional studies at Boston University and The New England Conservatory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Seating is limited and first come, first served.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priority will be given to those who register in advance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Check-in begins 30 minutes before the event and early arrival is suggested.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is in-person only.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Photo courtesy of the performer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Do you want to learn strategies to assess and address any lack of understanding your colleagues have used with mentees that have worked well? &lt;/em&gt;Join fellow research mentors for a conversation on ways to assess your mentee&amp;rsquo;s understanding of the discipline, especially of core research concepts, led by CTL facilitators trained by the &lt;a href=\"https://cimerproject.org/\"&gt;Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research&lt;/a&gt; (CIMER).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Determining whether our mentees understand the content and processes of our disciplines is not easy, yet doing so is critical for a productive mentoring relationship. Through facilitated discussions and case studies, we will collectively surface multiple strategies that you can use to identify potential causes for when mentees struggle with understanding and how to address them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this session, research mentors will explore how to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assess their mentees&amp;rsquo; understanding of core concepts and processes, including possible reasons for a lack of understanding.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use multiple strategies to enhance mentee understanding.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unable to join us for this discussion on mentoring?

Eight international instruments related to human rights have been implemented into the Kosovar legal order; they apply directly to the Republic of Kosovo and have priority, in the case of conflict, over the provisions of laws and acts of other public institutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the Constitutional Court of Kosovo has issued its first cases deciding on the obligations of state authorities established in Articles 18 (General Obligations), 50 (Immediate response, prevention, and protection), and 51 (Risk assessment and risk management) of the Istanbul Convention.&lt;/p&gt;",

In this short presentation, Judith offers a glimpse of the older worlds of the songs and their largely lost life contexts. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore wedding songs, where the bride is &amp;ldquo;between the sea and the sand,&amp;rdquo; narrative ballads whose words bridge centuries and whose tunes bridge continents, songs whose contrafactum tunes bridge the sacred and the profane, and others, in Sephardic cultures from Morocco, former Ottoman lands, and some of their secondary diasporas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judith Cohen&lt;/strong&gt; is a Canadian ethnomusicologist, singer, storyteller, and inveterate traveller. Known internationally for her research on and traditional performances of Sephardic songs, she also works with Crypto-Jewish practices in Portugal and Brazil, medieval music and music traditions of the Sephardic diaspora in Morocco, former Ottoman lands, and their widespread diasporas. Dr. Cohen is also the editor and consultant for the Alan Lomax Spain-1952 collection. She recently returned from several weeks in Brazil, conducting fieldwork and giving concerts and talks. She teaches part-time at York University in Toronto, and, several decades ago was the secretary of Columbia&amp;rsquo;s East Asian Institute on the same floor and in the same building that IIJS occupies today. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.judithcohen.ca&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=009klHSCxuh5AI1vNQzSO0KGjl4nbi2Q0M1QLJX9BeE&amp;amp;r=Rw9DJGZuSDaO77R6d0CTV9zulTsvHjMTEyFG_9R0vJM&amp;amp;m=bkJUG2PaqC3F2hzcpY7cH1IFa7JxWrpcK_u6mACzDewyVfaXMnjMgvZ-AUrciR-g&amp;amp;s=ZeHlJRI4q-94-sDukWo4EomyAiIISvg9R4Xn1Zt0KMk&amp;amp;e=\"&gt;www.judithcohen.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/worlds-of-judeo-spanish-songs-with-judith-cohen-tickets-1221530483559?aff=oddtdtcreator\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;REGISTER TO ATTEND THIS EVENT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This event was made possible by the generosity of Appel and Kaye families.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While all IIJS events are free and open to the public, we do encourage a suggested &lt;a href=\"https://www.givenow.columbia.edu/?_sa=05376&amp;amp;_sd=386#\"&gt;donation&lt;/a&gt; of $10.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Digital hyperconnectivity has reshaped political life by transforming regimes of knowing, regimes of feeling, and regimes of governing. It has altered ways of knowing the public world by weakening epistemic authority, reinforcing epistemic suspicion and distrust, and eroding the foundations of a shared public world, contributing thereby to epistemic paralysis on the one hand and epistemic polarization on the other. Hyperconnectivity has altered regimes of public feeling by encouraging the expression and mobilization of moral outrage and thereby deepening partisan antipathy and affective polarization. And it has altered regimes of governing by enabling new modalities of algorithmic regulation, public and private.&amp;nbsp; The talk concludes by highlighting the tension between the technocratic premises and modalities of algorithmic governance and the populist regimes of digitally mediated knowing and feeling and by specifying how hyperconnectivity can promote both populism and its seeming antithesis, technocracy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers Brubaker&lt;/strong&gt; is Distinguished Professor of Sociology at UCLA, where he holds the UCLA Foundation Chair.&amp;nbsp; He has written widely on social theory, citizenship, nationalism, ethnicity, religion, gender, populism, and digital hyperconnectivity.

This body of work encompasses photographic series, thousands of documents, ephemera, and found objects. While research often takes him inside formal party, state, and security police archives, this broader visual practice reimagines the idea of the archive itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;M&amp;euml;hilli&amp;rsquo;s work captures Tirana&amp;rsquo;s bewildering transition from communist-era central planning to neoliberalism. The collapse of the party-state in the early 1990s triggered a mass migration to the periphery of the city, which was ill-equipped to handle it. Ordinary residents transformed into amateur architects, converting ground floors into shops and adding illegal floors to prefabricated blocks. Various governments have tried to dominate the city, but Tirana tends to defy them, pursuing an unruled life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As tourism surges today, star architects flock to the capital to design gleaming high-rises. The construction craze and the steep rise in real estate prices puts immense pressure on historical landmarks located on valuable land. In this heady rush to attract money and attention&amp;mdash;to reinvent a city and a country so that it becomes legible to the West&amp;mdash;what to do with versions of the past deemed &lt;em&gt;unmarketable&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a process that began with earlier shows at galleries at Cornell University (2005) and Princeton University (2007), M&amp;euml;hilli explores this ongoing tug-of-war. He tracks the transformation of familiar places of his teenage years, like the raw graffitied fa&amp;ccedil;ade of a housing block that served as a backdrop to a playground and a mysterious kiosk stuffed with old books that has somehow survived the decades of turmoil. He assembles textual and visual biographies of erased architecture, documents the denials to his requests for access to classified archival files, collects &amp;ldquo;obsolete history&amp;rdquo; discarded along city streets, and writes editorials for local papers, putting together a counter-archive to a country struggling with its past and desperate to plug itself into global circuits of capital.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in incorporating climate justice into your teaching practice? Apply for Climate Wayfinding: Teaching for Climate Healing to experiment with new pedagogical practices to meet the needs of a changing world. Throughout the six meetings and modules, we will explore how to address the emotionality of the climate crisis, incorporate climate content and competencies across the curriculum, infuse ecological values throughout the classroom experience, and make a plan for next steps and implementation. Participants will leave with a fuller understanding of their own climate engagement, a plan for supporting students in theirs, and a climate-informed teaching artifact for their teaching portfolios. In short:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;look inward&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; exploring our climate emotions, core motivations, guiding values, and skills and &amp;ldquo;superpowers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;look outward&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;exploring climate solutions, accelerators for change, and our unique contexts and communities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;look forward &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;exploring our visions of the future and creating a personalized &amp;ldquo;climate compass&amp;rdquo;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and plan.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This in-person seminar is presented as a learning community in which participants engage with learning materials outside of the session, then come together as a cohort to digest and activate those materials together. Note that this seminar invites participants to share motivations and experiences that can be deeply personal, so please join with an openness to vulnerability and collective care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Participants who attend all workshops and complete all assignments will receive a letter from the CTL certifying completion.

From banking to breweries, sectors emerged out of nowhere, in a country that had never had a functioning economy. For the next three turbulent decades, a wild, proto-capitalist free-for-all transformed Russian society.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2022, Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The market started to collapse; Western firms fled Moscow&amp;#39;s skyscrapers. No country this large had ever transformed itself as dizzyingly as 1990s Russia--now, just as dramatically, it was over. The intervening decades had seen phenomenal successes and crushing failures; the creation and destruction of enormous fortunes. How did it all happen?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Zero Sum&amp;quot; brings to life the complex, vivid color of one of the greatest experiments in the history of global commerce. What have businesses learnt--or failed to learn--from this adventure, both about Russia and about dynamics between countries and companies in the face of relentless change?&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;Caste has long been treated as a peculiar social institution that sets South Asia apart from geographies structured by modern systems of classification. As such, claims to modernity in the subcontinent and in South Asian diasporas are often made through a disavowal of caste. A parallel strand of scholarship and politics insists on the historicity of caste and its role in constituting contemporary political and economic orders. Much of the latter work on the modernity of caste illuminates its continuing operations as a social structure of dispossession, enclosure, and accumulation, while a subset attends to how it simultaneously recedes from view. In this talk, Ajantha Subramanian addresses the dialectics of marking and unmarking through which caste remains an essential but commonly unremarked feature of contemporary social and political life, the fierce contestation over efforts to subject it to critical scrutiny, and the differences between elite and subaltern articulations of castelessness.

And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean more work for the instructor or TAs. This learning community will focus on how to design assessments that invite and value student creativity. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss what works, what doesn&amp;rsquo;t, how to connect students with available resources, and construct rubrics for evaluation. Part 1 of this learning community will focus on structuring non-traditional assignments, including discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of taking a more creative approach. In part 2, participants will explore approaches to evaluating non-conventional assignments. As part of this learning community, participants will have the opportunity to design their own creative assignments, and collaborate with other attendees to strategize methods of assessing those assignments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This two-part Learning Community is in-person&lt;/strong&gt; and will be co-facilitated by Miriam Nielsen and Grant Woods, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning.

The chapters analyze such important topics as the postcolonial retrieval of the past, the deconstruction of post-Soviet visualities, representations of violence and atrocities in the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine, and the notion of art as a mechanism of civic resistance and identity-building. The book will be of interest to scholars of art history, Eastern European studies, cultural studies, decolonial studies, and postcolonial studies.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skulls, Sculptures and the Kaiser&amp;rsquo;s Museums: Global Entanglements, Colonial Race Science, and German Memory Culture (c. 1900-today)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What can museums tell us about a nation&amp;rsquo;s self-image? How does Germany approach its colonial past in light of the Holocaust? Berlin&amp;rsquo;s national museums have become the focus of current debates around repatriation and colonial collections &amp;ndash; most visibly those now housed inside the contested Humboldt Forum. But the Humboldt Forum is just the beginning.This talk moves beyond the ethnological collections inside the resurrected Prussian castle in the center of Berlin. It ties recent discussions to other, hitherto neglected sites, such as the seemingly unproblematic antiquity collections from the former Ottoman Empire on Berlin&amp;rsquo;s Museum Island, and collections of human remains from &amp;lsquo;German East Africa&amp;#39; held in the storage facilities on the city&amp;rsquo;s periphery. How were all these collections entangled not only with each other but also with global networks of trade, material extraction and exploitative labour? In the late nineteenth century, these collections were furthermore exploited to consolidate triumphalist narratives of &amp;#39;Western civilization&amp;#39; and human history &amp;ndash; not least by providing the raw materials for a new form of &amp;lsquo;scientific&amp;rsquo; antisemitism and racism that developed around 1900 onwards: with fatal consequences in the twentieth century. In spite of these problematic legacies, however, Berlin&amp;rsquo;s urban center still reflects an imperial mindset in the wake of an affirmative monumentalization of the Wilhelmine era. This tells us as much about race and memory politics in Germany today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following the lecture, Mirjam Brusius will be joined in conversation by Professor Avinoam Shalem,&amp;nbsp;Riggio Professor of the History of the Arts of Islam&amp;nbsp;(Columbia University).&amp;nbsp;A reception will conclude the evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to the public. Registration is required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mirjam S. Brusius&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a cultural historian with a PhD in the History and Philosophy of Science from the University of Cambridge and an MA from the Humboldt-Universit&amp;auml;t zu Berlin.&amp;nbsp;Currently, Mirjam is a&amp;nbsp;Research Fellow in Colonial and Global History&amp;nbsp;at the German Historical Institute London.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each year the annual&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;Lecture, presented by the Columbia Department of Germanic Languages, seeks to honor the legacy of the progressive&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;publishing house founded by Rudolf&amp;nbsp;Mosse, which helped to shape the democratic public sphere during the German Weimar Republic. Descendants of the&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;Family include Prof. George L&amp;nbsp;Mosse, the acclaimed historian of fascism, Dr. Hilde L.&amp;nbsp;Mosse, a distinguished child psychiatrist who worked with Harlem children suffering from reading disabilities, Hans Strauch, an accomplished architect, and Roger Strauch, a successful high technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Hans and Roger co-lead The&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;Foundation&amp;#39;s efforts to sustain and promote the&amp;nbsp;Mosse&amp;nbsp;Family&amp;#39;s philanthropic legacy to support distinguished educational, research, health, and arts institutions and progressive causes.&lt;/p&gt;",

This inevitably led to great diversity in the lives of its inhabitants, shaping modern Ukraine into the multiethnic country it is today. Despite being subjected to different and conflicting power models during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Ukraine was not only imagined as a distinct entity with a unique culture and history but was also realized as a set of social and political institutions. The story of modern Ukraine is geopolitically complex, encompassing the historical narratives of several major communities &amp;ndash; including ethnic Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, and Russians &amp;ndash; who for centuries lived side by side.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bilenky will argue that there are a few key lessons we all can learn from studying Ukraine in the &amp;ldquo;long&amp;rdquo; nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;",

Devised as a regime to spatialise settler-colonialism, urban land-use planning continues to enable dispossession, expulsion and extraction at scales from the mundane to the spectacular. Drawing inspiration from the Indigenous concept of Country in so-called Australia and the fact of Indigenous sovereignty-never-ceded, the lecture will examine contemporary housing and land politics and struggles, and trouble the view of land, planning, housing and justice from a site of structural ruin.&lt;/p&gt;",

And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean more work for the instructor or TAs. This learning community will focus on how to design assessments that invite and value student creativity. We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss what works, what doesn&amp;rsquo;t, how to connect students with available resources, and construct rubrics for evaluation. Part 1 of this learning community will focus on structuring non-traditional assignments, including discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of taking a more creative approach. In part 2, participants will explore approaches to evaluating non-conventional assignments. As part of this learning community, participants will have the opportunity to design their own creative assignments, and collaborate with other attendees to strategize methods of assessing those assignments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This two-part Learning Community is in-person&lt;/strong&gt; and will be co-facilitated by Miriam Nielsen and Grant Woods, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning.

      "description": "&lt;p&gt;This panel brings together Indigenous scholars to critically examine the historical and ongoing impacts of exploration, scientific research, and anthropology on Indigenous communities in Papua New Guinea and Hawai&amp;lsquo;i. Panelists will explore the intersections of Indigenous rights, data sovereignty, and the colonial legacies embedded within scientific knowledge production. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The panelists will reflect on how historical expeditions and research projects extracted knowledge, resources, and data from Indigenous lands and bodies, often without consent or reciprocity. They will interrogate the ways in which scientific and anthropological institutions have upheld colonial power structures, while also considering how Indigenous scholars and communities are reclaiming control over their knowledge and data. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through discussions of biocultural heritage, climate research, conservation, and food sovereignty, this panel will highlight efforts to establish ethical research frameworks that respect Indigenous sovereignty. Drawing from experiences in both New Guinea and Hawai&amp;lsquo;i, the panelists will address contemporary movements toward Indigenous-led research methodologies, legal protections, and data governance models that center Indigenous epistemologies and self-determination. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By placing these diverse yet interconnected histories and struggles in conversation, this panel challenges dominant narratives of scientific exploration and proposes pathways toward decolonial, community-centered knowledge practices that honor Indigenous rights, agency, and futures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://erm.yale.edu/people/hiilei-hobart\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Hi&amp;lsquo;ilei Hobart&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Ethnicity, Race, and Migration at Yale University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://anthropology.princeton.edu/people/ikaika-ramones\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Ikaika Ramones&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Princeton University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/nayahamui-rooney\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nayahamui Rooney&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Lecturer in Culture, History, and Language at Australian National University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.synchronicityearth.org/about-us/our-people/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Miriam Supuma&lt;/a&gt;, Programme Manager at Synchronicity Earth&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moderated by &lt;a href=\"https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/paige-west\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Paige West&lt;/a&gt;, Claire Tow Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/indigenous-sovereignty-in-science-and-data-registration-1228183222079\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

Inventing the Modern tells the stories of trailblazing women, ranging from cofounder Abby Aldrich Rockefeller to longtime registrar Dorothy Dudley. Influential curators like Dorothy Miller shaped the course of American art and inventive leaders like MoMA's first director of publicity Sarah Newmeyer captured the public‚Äôs imagination. They created new models for how to envision, establish, and operate a museum in an era when the field of modern art was uncharted territory.",

The documentary highlights the¬†young French people of African descent, turning to the continent in search of, what they say, is a better life. It explores this \"reverse migration\", following their journeys to Senegal, the opposite their parents made decades earlier.

The film sheds light on themes of belonging, identity, and the evolving relationship between Africa and its diaspora, offering a fresh perspective on migration and cross-cultural ties.A driving force behind The Homecoming,¬†Jimenez's¬†debut feature-length film draws inspiration from her own upbringing in Europe. The project reflects her commitment to uncovering untold narratives‚Äîtranscending traditional reporting to craft immersive, human-centered stories that resonate worldwide.¬†Conversation to include Sean Jacobs and¬†Kristen Saloomey, board member of the Foreign Press Association, which represents US based journalists working for foreign media outlets.",

      "description": "This event is open to current New School faculty and students only. You must have a New School email address to register.¬†Abstract: Walter Benjamin‚Äôs seminal essay,¬†The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical Reproducibility, explores how new systems of work, machines, and techniques fundamentally reshape not only everyday sensory experiences, such as sight and hearing, but also space and time. Benjamin examines these transformations through the interplay of art and politics, grounding his analysis in the concept of ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù and discussing its implications for both domains. He develops these reflections in relation to radio, photography, and film in the early twentieth¬†century. However, these reflections can be traced back to the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century and forward to the present, which is dominated by new digital technologies. In each instance, the introduction of new technologies has provoked instability in the relationship between democracy and authority. This paper seeks to explore this tension further, highlighting the risks as well as the possibilities that such instability entails.¬†Bio:¬†Massimiliano Tomba serves as Chair and Professor in the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. His research spans German philosophy, Critical Theory, Political Theory, Postcolonial Studies, and the Philosophy of History. Among his publications is¬†Insurgent Universality: An Alternative Legacy of Modernity¬†(Oxford University Press, 2019). His forthcoming book,¬†Revolution and Restoration: The Politics of Anachronism, is currently in publication with Fordham University Press.",

This event celebrates his global legacy on Black nationalism, internationalism, and anti-colonial and anti-imperial movements. The celebration includes two academic panels, artistic installations, and community discussions.¬†Join us for two panel discussions on Feb. 28th. More details and times to follow.***‚ÄúWomen of Color and Malcolm X‚Äôs Enduring Legacy‚ÄùThis panel examines the profound impact that Black women had on Malcolm X's political thought as well as the enduring influence of his legacy on diverse women of color worldwide. Moderated by Dr. Mona Oraby, the first conversation features Mapping Malcolm editor Najha Zigbi-Johnson and Afro-Caribbean American Muslim artist Nsenga Knight, both of whom draw upon their creative practice and writing to explore how Black women shaped Malcolm‚Äôs evolving understanding of Black radicalism and internationalism. The second conversation highlights Dr. Maytha Alhassen and Dr. Denise Lim both of whom discuss how Malcolm X‚Äôs legacy continues to inspire Black-Arab and Black-Asian solidarities today.***\"Malcolm X, Internationalist\"The centenary of Malcolm X's birth offers a unique opportunity to explore his profound international impact beyond U.S. borders. This panel will analyze Malcolm‚Äôs advocacy for African Americans at the United Nations‚Äîlinking U.S. racism to internal colonialism, his relationship with the Islamic world and his trips to Africa, and his engagement with intellectuals and activists from outside the US not only influenced his perspectives on global liberation movements and socialism, but his relevance to contemporary political movements.",

      "description": "This 10-week online seminar investigates the situation of the Syrian and Sudani women under authoritarian regimes, particularly during wartime. While some autocracies may promote women's rights to secure loyalty, Syria has a long-standing history of gender discrimination that intensified during the ongoing conflict.¬†Similarly, Sudan is currently experiencing unprecedented levels of conflict, with intense violence in regions like Khartoum, Darfur, and Kordofan. This ongoing crisis has significantly increased the dangers for women and girls, who face heightened risks of sexual violence, exploitation, and abuse.¬†This seminar seeks to shed light on the systematic repression of women activists and the difficulties they encounter. Topics will include methods of detention, the use of sexual assault as a weapon of humiliation, concepts of protection through the increase of child and minor marriages, escalation of crimes of honors,¬†challenges of the new life in displacement or exile, UN SC Resolution 1325 Women, Peace and Security: Issues and instruments.It advocates for a comprehensive strategy to empower women and ensure their meaningful involvement on all levels of governance, which is essential for achieving lasting peace in Syria and Sudan.",

      "description": "‚ÄúGreening‚Äù industrial agriculture has been a stated goal of European policy for three decades, but agroecological schemes in place have so far had little effect on reducing its deleterious consequences on the environment. While the post-war transition to a highly mechanized and chemical-dependent large-scale agriculture was a systemic endeavor that mobilized all components of rural societies, agroecology is on the other end only timidly pushed, as a set of piecemeal instruments, by policymakers who do not wish to alter the free-market foundations of the food industry.In regions of historically intensive agriculture, where landscapes and ecosystems have been simplified to a minimum, the preservation and development of the few remaining ecosystem services have been seemingly ‚Äúoutsourced‚Äù from the farmers to a variety of public, private and non-profit actors‚Äîeach pursuing their own specific goal, from flood management to ecological compensation‚Äîand reconfiguring a landscape that had long lost its ecological amenities. But is the apparent divorce between agriculture and landscape production something to rejoice over? Who actually gets to shape rural productive landscapes and decide its uses? How much of a democratic process can‚Äîand should‚Äîlandscape production be? Based on the initial stages of a doctoral dissertation and through the example of a rural territory in Northern France, this presentation aims at opening a discussion on the power relations behind seemingly mundane but strategic landscapes.",

What role does that ugliness play in fomenting hatred? Moshtari Hilal, an Afghan-born author and artist who lives in Germany, has written a touching, intimate, and highly political book. Dense body hair, crooked teeth, and big noses: Hilal uses a broad cultural lens to question norms of appearance‚Äîostensibly her own, but in fact everyone‚Äôs. She writes about beauty salons in Kabul as a backdrop to the US invasion of Afghanistan, Darwin‚Äôs theory of evolution, Kim Kardashian, and a utopian place in the shadow of her nose. With a profound mix of essay, poetry, her own drawings, and cultural and social history of the body, Hilal explores notions of repulsion and attraction, taking the reader into the most personal of realms to put self-image to the test. Why are we afraid of ugliness?",

The curriculum is designed to assess how translated Arabic literature can contribute to enriching Arab cultural identity, countering historical stereotypes rooted in the Western consciousness.¬†Emphasizing the bridging of ages and cultures, the course explores seminal works like The Arabian Nights and Kalila Wa Dimnah while also delving into modern themes such as the intersection of Arabic literature and ecofeminism, and contemporary Arabic exile literature. Through engaging debates and readings, students are invited to cultivate a nuanced understanding of the challenges, controversies, and transformative potential inherent in the translation and reception of Arabic literary texts, ultimately fostering a meaningful connection between Arab and Western societies through the powerful medium of literature.",

      "description": "What is the political economy of ‚Äúlate‚Äù mass incarceration? How has the globally unparalleled US system of mass imprisonment remained impervious to two decades of critique and a decade of anti-carceral mass-mobilization? The harms of mass incarceration are well documented, and its failure to foster safety in our communities is, in the academy at least, uncontroversial. However, the current levels of government spending are themselves politically uncontroversial, whilst political elites are again timorous about reform as the MAGA movement reinvigorates the debased ‚Äòtough vs. soft‚Äô on crime discourse.¬†This conference seeks to turn the lens of political economy on this apparent impasse, in the hope that attention to the distribution and contestation of power and resources can help us to understand the resilience of these institutions, and to move past modest declines in aggregate incarceration rates and into an actual post-mass-incarceration future.This conference is¬†open to anyone¬†invested in understanding or achieving a decarceral transition (academics, organizers, everyone).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------¬†Call For Papers from Graduate Students:We will include exciting graduate student work from across disciplines that addresses the conference's core questions. The work can be complete or in progress. Submit a brief abstract to¬†Dion Nania¬†(nanid359@newschool.edu) and¬†Eric Seligman (selig056@umn.edu) by January 31, 2025. Unfortunately, we do not have funds available to assist with travel, but we will provide a couple meals and some beverages at the event.¬†Non-exhaustive list of possible topics:-What is the relationship between the carceral state, broadly defined, and labor markets?-What is the role of prison work in the carceral political economy?-What can we learn from the application of a racial capitalism lens?-What defines the contemporary post-COVID period within neoliberal capitalism, and what is the nature of the associations between these economic trends and penal trends?-How can a comparative lens help bring into view what is truly unique about the disposition and staying power of carceral solutions in the U.S.?-What is the political economy of the proliferation of 'cop cities'?-How does analysis of carceral political economy inform the praxis of contemporary anti-carceral social movements?Please reach out to the organizers with any questions: Dion Nania (nanid359@newschool.edu) and Eric Seligman (selig056@umn.edu).¬†Funded in part by the NSSR Dean's Conference Fund",

Far exceeding traditional notions of ‚Äúgood manners,‚Äù protocols are systems of language that regulate how we relate to each other, to our cultural, social, and political environments, and to the technologies that create them. The first publication to look at protocols across a wide range of disciplines, As for Protocols¬†features essays, artworks, conversations, and scores by twenty-four international contributors who speak to protocols as practice‚Äîneither conventional mannerisms nor abstract concepts, but material processes, relational affinities, shared responsibilities, and mutual care. What emerges from the book‚Äôs pages are tools for empowerment, ways in which protocols can be rebooted, reengineered, embodied, appropriated, and used to our own ends.The As for Protocols launch brings together the book‚Äôs editors‚ÄîRe‚Äôal Christian, Carin Kuoni, and Eriola Pira‚Äîwith contributors: artist Salome Asega, scholar Shannon Mattern, performer Silas Riener, and artist Robert Sember of the sound art collective Ultra-red.

As a long-time executor and trustee of Arendt‚Äôs literary estate, he edited, published, and wrote introductions to numerous books, essays, and other writings that have played an essential role in disseminating her work and shaping her legacy over the past 30 years.¬†Please join us in honoring, remembering and celebrating Jerome Kohn, his keen insight, kindness, dedication and commitment, and his enduring contributions both to The New School community and to the discipline at large.¬†¬†¬†*********************************************************************Jerome (Jerry) Kohn was a philosopher, a preeminent scholar and confidante of Hannah Arendt, and a crucial member of the NSSR‚Äôs liberal studies program.¬†Kohn completed his undergraduate degree in literature at Harvard University and proceeded to graduate study in philosophy at Columbia University. He met Hannah Arendt in the late 1960s and continued his studies with her at The New School for Social Research, while also working as her teaching and research assistant. When Arendt died in December 1975, Kohn spoke at her funeral on behalf of Arendt‚Äôs students. Following¬†Arendt's death, Kohn worked with the American writer Mary McCarthy and German literary scholar Lotte K√∂hler, then trustees of Arendt‚Äôs literary estate, on transferring her papers and library to the archives of the Library of Congress and of Bard College. McCarthy‚Äôs posthumous edition of Arendt‚Äôs¬†The Life of the Mind¬†(1978) is based on years of assistance and collaboration with Kohn.¬† He was director of the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program at The New School from 1980 to 1985, which he was instrumental in creating, and was the founding director of the Hannah Arendt Center at the New School for Social Research in New York. In 2001, he became trustee of the Hannah Arendt Bluecher Literary Trust. In addition to directing the Center at the New School, Kohn facilitated the formation of Arendt Centers at the University of Oldenburg (Germany) and at Bard College, where he received an honorary degree in 2022. In 2019, he¬†was awarded the ‚ÄúHannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought‚Äù (Bremen/Germany). Kohn‚Äôs support was essential in the establishment of the new¬†Critical Edition of the Complete Works of Hannah Arendt¬†(Wallstein Verlag, 2018-present). He maintained correspondence with a great network of scholars, writers, archivists, and artists throughout the world and was an indispensable resource for information about Arendt‚Äôs life and work. He was also a trusted friend and advisor, and a peerless raconteur.",

But too much that is written about immigration fails to appreciate the complex responses to the phenomenon. Too many observers assume imaginary consensus, avoid basic questions, or disregard the larger context for human migration. In Borders and Belonging, Hiroshi Motomura offers a complex and fair-minded account of immigration, its root causes, and the varying responses to it. Taking stock of the issue's complexity, while giving credence to the opinions of immigration critics, he tackles a series of important questions that, when answered, will move us closer to a more realistic and sustainable immigration policy.",

Registration is required; click through for the registration link. Zoom information will be provided via confirmation email to registered participants. Expanding the Ancient World is a series of professional development workshops and online resources for teachers. Writing is such an integral part of our everyday lives that it is difficult to imagine how we could live without it. But just like so many of the other technologies that have become essential to us, writing had to be invented. Scholars studying the ancient past have discovered that writing was invented independently in four different places: in Mesopotamia (in modern-day Iraq) around 3300-3200 BCE; in ancient Egypt around 3200 BCE; in ancient China around 1200 BCE; and in ancient Mesoamerica (in modern-day Mexico) around 1000 BCE. In this workshop, we will focus on the invention of writing in Mesopotamia.",

Come join us for an introductory through-hole solderSoldering is one of the most important skills you'll need for working with electronics. Come join us for an introductory through-hole soldering workshop. Soldering enables you to create sturdy connections between electrical components. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to use a soldering iron safely and effectively, and get plenty of practice with both soldering and de-soldering techniques. We'll be soldering up some Game of Life kits - LED tiles that generate nifty animations. No previous experience is required, making this introductory workshop a great choice for anyone who's curious about getting started with hardware tinkering! All materials will be provided.\nOK, awesome, I want to join!\nPlease be ready to start at 1pm! We find that you will need this time to get through the whole class. Our classes tend to sell out about a week in advance so if you're interested, you may want to sign up early.\nThis class will be taught by Resistor member Raphael.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/. Please note that refunds must be requested 72 hours in advance.

Building your own gear doesn't have to be a solitary hobby anymore... has regular meetups to share recent DIY audio projects (speakers, amps, DACs, etc - anything home-audio related), as well as talks and demos on related topics and skills (how to solder, how digital crossovers work, fabrication techniques, digital room correction, etc).\nThis month we're going to show off some new and exciting speaker and amp projects, a demo on how to refurbish a classic iPod(!), and we'll also have a tutorial on how to simulate bass-reflex enclosures in WinISD - a key skill for anyone looking to design their own speakers.It always sounds better when you build it yourself.\nHave a project you'd like to share? Let us know at diyaudio@gowanusaudio.com and we'll add it to the list.\n(If history is any guide, at the end of the meetup some of us will want to keep talking about projects and we'll move to a bar nearby - join us!)\nWho should come?\nOpen to anyone interested in DIY home audio who wants to learn and make some new friends - all experience levels welcome. If you've ever wanted to build any audio gear, we're here for you. (We generally don't focus on production, live sound, musical instruments, or making music, although there certainly is some overlap.)\nNote from the organizer, Pete:\nI started diyaudio.nyc a couple years ago because I wanted to meet some like-minded folks near me - I knew they were out there. And they are! Thank you for being a part! Let's grow this group! These days, for me, it's all audio all the time - I work as a Buyer for The Music Room buying high end audio equipment, and also offer complete classes to build your own equipment as Gowanus Audio.\nThis is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com\n",

All materials provided.Lizzy Gee, a sustainable fashion designer, leads a lesson in how to make various accessories by upcycling fabric scraps and using them as the decorative colorant within eco-resin! They’ve been experimenting and honing this innovative craft, that uses a material that is NOT plastic to mold into any shape you can imagine. They use the genius method of embedding the smallest scraps from their collections, so that nothing goes to waste.This workshop is perfect for those who want learn to do resin-pours, textile artists who want to make brilliant use of your smallest scraps, and anyone who wants to spend a few hours making your own beautiful jewelry, beads, pendants, keychains, or experiment with a new sustainable method! Choose between a pair of earrings, necklace, buttons and/or keychain!All materials are supplied! Eco-Resin, molds, and a dehydrator for a faster drying process! Bring your own beloved too-good-to-toss scraps, or use Lizzy Gee’s gorgeous textile tidbits! Also, while we wait for your creations to dry, feel free to bring your own mending/sewing/textile projects and get advice from a seasoned sustainable designer about next steps. Lizzy is open to all levels of maker and hopes to see you there!\nNo experience required! You just need to be interested in sustainability and/or textiles. Everyone is welcome.Your Instructor:\nLizzy has always found it natural to express her ideas with a visual language. Lizzy saw the design process as a self-empowering tool to make her ideas transcend to reality and foster a genuine inclusivity.  By age 11, she was creating entire collections from inspiration to runway.  A native of Philadelphia, Lizzy moved to Brooklyn, New York to pursue her dream of creating a sustainable, inclusive fashion brand.  She attended Pratt Institute after earning a scholarship in their Fashion Design program.  After graduating with honors in 2018, she continued to develop her brand and has showcased her collections in Fashion Weeks in New York, London, and Philadelphia.  Not only did she launch her business within the first of year of graduating, but also founded a sustainable New York Fashion Week initiative called IMPACT NYFW.  Practicing sustainable design with her brand, she wanted to further transcend eco-conscious methods in regards to how designs were presented by acting on another passion- event production. IMPACT is an annual, alternative New York fashion week platform for emerging, sustainable designers to showcase their work while making an impact beyond the runway by donating ticket proceeds to an environmental non-profit. Along with IMPACT, her award-winning designs have been showcased in galleries at Moore College of Art and Design, University of the Arts Philadelphia, Pratt Institute, and Screaming Mimi's NYC front window display.  While studying fashion at Pratt, Lizzy apprenticed for many successful designers, including Christian Siriano, Badgley Mischka, Mara Hoffman, and Nicola Formichetti. Not only have her colorful designs been worn by music artists, such as, Grimes and Kimbra, but they’ve also been highlighted in publications including British Vogue and Schon! magazine. Lizzy is continuing to build her sustainable brand with the mission of giving the world innovative perspectives of beauty and functional design by breaking the boundaries of social constructs limiting our potential as individuals.This is a masks optional workshop.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

While everyone else is still building wrappers around LLMs, the sharpest builders are crafting the autonomous systems that will define the next decade. Women make up just 22% of AI professionals worldwide and only 12% of AI researchers – but that changes here, today, with us.​This isn't another hackathon. This is where the future gets built.​What We're Building​Real agents. Real autonomy. Real impact.​We're talking multi-agent systems that reason, plan, and execute without handholding. Supply chain orchestrators. Research companions that think alongside you. Personal AI that actually understands context. The kind of technology that recent winners like RiskWise have proven can tackle complex domains like supply chain risk analysis with AI agents that provide timely, game-changing insights.​Prize Categories:​Who Should Be Here​The Builders:​Engineers who think in systems, not just code​Researchers who want their work in production, not just papers​Founders building the next Anthropic, not the next ChatGPT wrapper​Women in AIwho are tired of being the only one in the room​The Visionaries:​Product leaders who understand that agents ≠ chatbots​Technical founders ready to 10x human capability​Anyone who believes diverse teams are better at identifying potential biases and blind spots in AI systems​Why This Matters for Women​Women's involvement in AI isn't just about technical expertise – it's crucial for ensuring AI solutions tackle ethical and social challenges. Diversity brings unique insights into the ethical and societal implications of AI, helping reduce bias and create technologies that better serve all members of society.​We're actively building the future we want to see:​50% of judging panel are women leaders in AI​Dedicated mentorship track with female AI executives​Networking designed for meaningful connections, not small talk​Direct pipeline to female-founded AI companies actively hiring​Co-hosted with The Residency​The Residency – where ambitious builders live and work alongside equally driven peers – brings their network of entrepreneurs who've already raised from a16z, Collaborative Fund, and other top-tier investors. With Sam Altman as startup advisor and a track record of supporting high-potential builders, this isn't just an event – it's your entry point into the ecosystem that shapes the future.​The Technical Stack​What you'll have access to:​$1000 in credits per team across OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, and Azure​Open source frameworks: LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel​Real datasets from partners (healthcare, finance, climate, supply chain)​GPU clusters for training custom models​Direct API access to latest frontier models​What we expect:​Working demos, not slide decks​Code that runs, not promises it will​Impact that scales, not toys that impress​The Details​When:September 6, 2025 (24 hours of pure building)Where:Location TBDTeam Size:1-4 peopleSkill Level:Intermediate to Expert (we'll have tech talks, but this isn't a tutorial)​What's Included:​Meals designed by actual humans who understand nutrition​Late-night debugging sessions with people who actually get it​Post-event investor connections for top teams​Apply Now​Space is intentionally limited to 200 builders. We're optimizing for signal, not noise.​Commitment required:Full 24 hours, no exceptions​Special consideration for:​Women in AI (we're serious about changing the demographics)​Technical teams with novel approaches to agent architecture​Builders who've shipped AI products in production​International participants​\"The future belongs to those who build it.

      "description": "​Genome editing tools allow the introduction of precise changes in the DNA. For this ability, they became indispensable for basic biological research and hold great promise for future therapeutic applications. The same technologies are being utilized also in early human embryos for better understanding of key developmental regulators and DNA repair mechanisms. In the future, precise correction of specific genes might enable curing devastating diseases early in the development or decreasing the risks of certain diseases. Although continuous research is needed before such an intervention becomes safe, the first gene-edited babies were already born. This talk aims to contribute to the debate about human germline gene editing by putting it into a broader context of human biology, discussing the benefits, current limitations, and possible future alternatives leading to the prevention of genetic diseases.Stepan Jerabek is a postdoctoral research scientist in the Pediatrics Department at Columbia University. He is also an associate scientist at IOCB Prague, an institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Stepan’s interest in early development and genome stability brought him to the Egli laboratory, where he uses genome editing tools to study DNA repair in human preimplantation embryos. In 2024, Stepan was the recipient of the Druckenmiller Fellowship Award from the New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute. Stepan completed his doctoral training at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Germany and was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, working in the lab of genetics pioneer George Church.🐦Stay Connected about Future Events:Twitter:@descinyc_Instagram:@descinyc​PS: Apply to be a member of the DeSci NYC group chat:https://forms.gle/AmUtotmCgWgGxWDp6",

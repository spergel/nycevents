In this class you'll learn everything you need.Harness the power of an Epilog 60 Watt Laser! In this class you'll learn everything you need to know to make the ideas in your head become a reality with a laser.\nIn this three hour class, you will learn:\nHow to set up a file for cutting on the laser cutter in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.Laser cutter safety including materials testing.Laser cutter operation including configuration, cuts and raster etching in common materials like wood, acrylic, cardboard and others.At the end of class, you will go home with:\nOne laser cut project, either the class default or a simple one of your own design (see below for details)Resistor Laser Certification, enabling you to use our laser on Craft Nights.Please bring the following to class:\nA laptop with either Inkscape (free: download here: https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.2.1/) or Adobe Illustrator installed.\nA USB jump drive\nThe following items are optional if you'd like to try cutting a simple custom design. If your file ends up being too complicated, we may have you do the class default project first, just to learn the laser in the time allotted - but we'll definitely help you with your more complex cut at a free Craft Night in future!\nAn SVG vector file of a simple shape you'd like to cut for your first cut.A piece of 1/8 inch or thinner wood, acrylic or cardboard you'd like to cut. If you can't bring your own material, small pieces will be made available, or larger pieces for purchase on site.Please be on time for the start of class!

We'll be soldering up some Game of Life kits - LED tiles that generate nifty animations. No previous experience is required, making this introductory workshop a great choice for anyone who's curious about getting started with hardware tinkering! All materials will be provided.\nOK, awesome, I want to join!\nPlease be ready to start at 1pm! We find that you will need this time to get through the whole class.

All materials provided.Lizzy Gee, a sustainable fashion designer, leads a lesson in how to make various accessories by upcycling fabric scraps and using them as the decorative colorant within eco-resin! They’ve been experimenting and honing this innovative craft, that uses a material that is NOT plastic to mold into any shape you can imagine. They use the genius method of embedding the smallest scraps from their collections, so that nothing goes to waste.This workshop is perfect for those who want learn to do resin-pours, textile artists who want to make brilliant use of your smallest scraps, and anyone who wants to spend a few hours making your own beautiful jewelry, beads, pendants, keychains, or experiment with a new sustainable method! Choose between a pair of earrings, necklace, buttons and/or keychain!All materials are supplied! Eco-Resin, molds, and a dehydrator for a faster drying process! Bring your own beloved too-good-to-toss scraps, or use Lizzy Gee’s gorgeous textile tidbits! Also, while we wait for your creations to dry, feel free to bring your own mending/sewing/textile projects and get advice from a seasoned sustainable designer about next steps. Lizzy is open to all levels of maker and hopes to see you there!\nNo experience required! You just need to be interested in sustainability and/or textiles. Everyone is welcome.Your Instructor:\nLizzy has always found it natural to express her ideas with a visual language. Lizzy saw the design process as a self-empowering tool to make her ideas transcend to reality and foster a genuine inclusivity.  By age 11, she was creating entire collections from inspiration to runway.  A native of Philadelphia, Lizzy moved to Brooklyn, New York to pursue her dream of creating a sustainable, inclusive fashion brand.  She attended Pratt Institute after earning a scholarship in their Fashion Design program.  After graduating with honors in 2018, she continued to develop her brand and has showcased her collections in Fashion Weeks in New York, London, and Philadelphia.  Not only did she launch her business within the first of year of graduating, but also founded a sustainable New York Fashion Week initiative called IMPACT NYFW.  Practicing sustainable design with her brand, she wanted to further transcend eco-conscious methods in regards to how designs were presented by acting on another passion- event production. IMPACT is an annual, alternative New York fashion week platform for emerging, sustainable designers to showcase their work while making an impact beyond the runway by donating ticket proceeds to an environmental non-profit. Along with IMPACT, her award-winning designs have been showcased in galleries at Moore College of Art and Design, University of the Arts Philadelphia, Pratt Institute, and Screaming Mimi's NYC front window display.  While studying fashion at Pratt, Lizzy apprenticed for many successful designers, including Christian Siriano, Badgley Mischka, Mara Hoffman, and Nicola Formichetti. Not only have her colorful designs been worn by music artists, such as, Grimes and Kimbra, but they’ve also been highlighted in publications including British Vogue and Schon! magazine. Lizzy is continuing to build her sustainable brand with the mission of giving the world innovative perspectives of beauty and functional design by breaking the boundaries of social constructs limiting our potential as individuals.This is a masks optional workshop.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

Join the NYC Resistor Ham Radio Club (call sign N2YCR) for our open and regular meetings, the 4th Wednesday of each month from 8:00 – 9:30 pm at NYC Resistor (87 3rd Avenue, 4th Floor).\nThe amateur radio hobby has something for everyone, from Morse code to modern digital modes. Bring projects you're working on, gear to fix, problems that puzzle you, outings you'd like to organize, or just yourself to meet &amp; greet your friendly local hams. Drop by the #n2ycr channel in Discord any time to say hi.\nYou do not need to be a member of Resistor to be a member of the club, nor do you need to be a licensed amateur radio operator (though of course we hope you'll become licensed with our help).\nWe aim to create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment to bring together Brooklyn's radio hackers, antenna experimenters, shortwave listeners, toroid winders, satellite chasers, and balloon launchers.\nCome make some noise in the weird and wonderful medium of radio!This is a masks optional event.\nAs with all NYC Resistor events, this class is 18+ and governed by our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct, as well as accessibility information, can be found at www.nycresistor.com/participate/.\nPlease note that refunds must be requested 24 hours in advance. If you have any questions, please email classes@nycresistor.com.\n",

      "description": "​Genome editing tools allow the introduction of precise changes in the DNA. For this ability, they became indispensable for basic biological research and hold great promise for future therapeutic applications. The same technologies are being utilized also in early human embryos for better understanding of key developmental regulators and DNA repair mechanisms. In the future, precise correction of specific genes might enable curing devastating diseases early in the development or decreasing the risks of certain diseases. Although continuous research is needed before such an intervention becomes safe, the first gene-edited babies were already born. This talk aims to contribute to the debate about human germline gene editing by putting it into a broader context of human biology, discussing the benefits, current limitations, and possible future alternatives leading to the prevention of genetic diseases.Stepan Jerabek is a postdoctoral research scientist in the Pediatrics Department at Columbia University. He is also an associate scientist at IOCB Prague, an institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Stepan’s interest in early development and genome stability brought him to the Egli laboratory, where he uses genome editing tools to study DNA repair in human preimplantation embryos. In 2024, Stepan was the recipient of the Druckenmiller Fellowship Award from the New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute. Stepan completed his doctoral training at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Germany and was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, working in the lab of genetics pioneer George Church.🐦Stay Connected about Future Events:Twitter:@descinyc_Instagram:@descinyc​PS: Apply to be a member of the DeSci NYC group chat:https://forms.gle/AmUtotmCgWgGxWDp6",

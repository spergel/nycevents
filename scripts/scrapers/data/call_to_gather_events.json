It\u2019s an artistry of mending broken pieces, symbolically representing how brokenness in our lives can transform to places of beauty and power. Instead of hiding chipped and broken parts,when imperfections are pronounced with the gold, symbolizing the light, you behold something that\u2019s more beautiful. It\u2019s an art form of mending to make new. In this Gather, we\u2019ll have an open time to share personal discovery with each other as we apply Kintsugi to a piece we\u2019ve each brought with us. We\u2019ll share a time of personal reflection and beholding through working with our hands.",

In this curated route, we will focus on the historic architecture of Harlem. As a neighborhood, Harlem is part physical, part mythical. The famed renaissance that transpired a hundred years ago has indelibly shaped the neighborhood\u2019s identity as a Mecca culture and placemaking in New York City. We will be cultivating the art of city walking, not as tourists, but as architecture-aficionados, learning to appreciate the details of Harlem\u2019s most distinct buildings and brownstones.",

In this Gather, we\u2019ll explore the art of dream interpretation. We\u2019ll process through writing and visuals, paying attention to the words, symbols, and prominent emotions of a specific dream. We\u2019ll get comfortable engaging with our dreams, entering a multi-layered conversation with them to record and understand what they may be communicating.",

      "description": "The art of Kintsugi embodies new beauty made through imperfections. It\u2019s an artistry of mending broken pieces, symbolically representing how brokenness in our lives can transform to places of beauty and power. Instead of hiding chipped and broken parts, when imperfections are pronounced with the gold, symbolizing the light, you behold something that\u2019s more beautiful. It\u2019s an art form of mending to make new. In this Gather, we\u2019ll have an open time to share personal discovery with each other as we apply Kintsugi to a piece we\u2019ve each brought with us. We\u2019ll share a time of personal reflection and beholding through working with our hands.",

In fact, a poem can help us say things we didn\u2019t have words for, can help us uncover things we didn\u2019t know or acknowledge within ourselves. For this Gather, we\u2019ll explore the world within. Through a guided writing time, we\u2019ll explore seven different movements of the mind\u2014different mental approaches to the same item or event. This gets us out of our usual patterns of thinking and remembering, and also gets us out of the anxiety of \u201cwhat am I going to write?\u201d We\u2019ll then craft a poem from the phrases we\u2019ve unearthed. We\u2019ll learn how to approach writing in a less direct and less pressured manner, and how to find the poetry that\u2019s already there\u2014in our own voices, in our own minds.",

In this Gather, we\u2019ll demystify the publishing process and answer some key questions about publishing houses, about the difference between self-publishing and traditional publishing, and about how to take the next step toward putting words into the world. Perhaps your idea for a book is freshly thought, or perhaps it\u2019s fully baked. Or perhaps you\u2019re simply curious about what it might take to publish a book. We\u2019ll spend time asking clarifying questions about our individual book ideas, and we\u2019ll each walk away with the bones of a book proposal.",

      "description": "Nathan Grayson, author of Stream Big: The Triumphs And Turmoils Of Twitch And The Stars Behind The Screen, is joined by Aftermath's Gita Jackson and Chris Person and Polygon's Simone de Rochefort for a discussion of the Amazon-owned livestreaming platform's place in modern gaming culture and beyond.\nHow did a website dedicated to watching people play video games grow into a force that has attracted attention from mainstream stars and politicians? What kind of work actually goes into being a popular Twitch streamer? Is it really as simple as sitting down in front of a camera and playing your favorite game? (No, absolutely not.) And how does one even begin to cover that as a journalist and write a book that encapsulates it all, especially when the world of livestreaming never stops, not even for a moment?\nCome for answers to all of these questions and stay for never-before-told stories about your favorite/least favorite streamers.\nrsvp",

We very much weren\u2019t expecting for things to last this long when we started this little experiment out but here we are heading into year 3 of 150+ bpm fuckery!\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ve got for ya for our anniversary. Tackycardia alum DJ Allegation will be returning following appearances at Silo and Bossa Nova Civic Club. In addition, New England legend Jack McDevitt (also of Disco Ball Murder Kit) will be making the trek into NYC to treat us with some fresh sounds. Arpanette comes through following appearances at Eris and Caf\u00e9 Kitsun\u00e9. Boj joins us following appearances at Happyfun Hideaway and the Cuff Complex while Tailz who heads Blast NYC comes following appearances at Eris, Trans Pecos and Hart Bar. The card will be rounded out by Tackycardia residents Cryostatik who recently put out 2 new tunes in Mess \u2018Em Up and Solace as well as Alex Viper who is fresh off of December appearances at Tropical Dreams festival and Garage Sale in Massachusetts in addition to the Stuck on Earth reunion event in NYC. As usual not all of our lineup is known for their high BPM antics so we\u2019re just as excited as y\u2019all are to see what fantastic sets come out. Getting DJs and audiences alike a tad out of their comfort zones is one of our favorite things about doing these events and we are gonna keep it up :) Make sure to follow our instagram @tackcyardia_nyc as we\u2019ll be posting a bit more about our artists in the lead up to the event!\nWe look forward to celebrating the occasion with y\u2019all. As usual it\u2019s a 150+ genrefluid affair with free entry and free to play arcade games. Donations are welcome to further support our events and can be made via cash in the tip bucket on the stage or via venmo through our QR code that you\u2019ll see posted around the venue. Here\u2019s to another year!\nrsvp",

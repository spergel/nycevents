      "description": "A community panel discussion and live broadcast on Radio AlHara, PalestineSaturday, Feb. 15, 5PM (doors) 6PM (panel)\n\n\nFeaturing :\n\n\nNadia Khayrallah\n, Dancers for Palestine\n\n\nSam Sundos\n, Palestinian-American interdisciplinary artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY\n\n\nYasmeen Abdallah\n, Artist and co-founder of Fiber Friends of Falastin\n\n\nLianah, Theater Workers for a Ceasefire\n\n\nDiscussion hosted by Montreal based musician and community organizer \nStefan Christoff\n.\n\n\nOrganized in collaboration with Interference Archive.\n\n\nThis event brings together a panel of cultural workers from the New York City area who have been actively organizing and taking collective action to support Palestine over the last year. This community panel discussion at \nInterference Archive\n will stream live globally at \nradioalhara.net\n and also directly at \nThe Wonder Cabinet\n in Bethlehem, Palestine.\u00a0\n\n\nThe goal of this event is to highlight the ways that cultural work is a key part of both broader community organizing practices and the contemporary movement to support Palestine. This discussion aims to highlight the ways that cultural work occurs as part of a process of exchange between artistic ideas but also organizational strategies that are built across grassroots organizing networks.\n\n\nThis panel builds on similar live community discussions with cultural workers that have recently taken place in other cities, also broadcast on Radio AlHara and hosted by Stefan Christoff, including in July 2024 at \nCasa do Comum\n in Lisbon, Portugal, in Amsterdam in Nov. at \nOT301\n, in Mexico City in Feb. 2024 at Radio Nopal (\naudio\n) and in Sofia, Bulgaria at the \n\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430 Feminist cultural space\n.\u00a0\n\n\nInformation on the speakers and participating groups / collectives:\n\n\nDrawing from the personal and the political through resilience and persistence, \nYasmeen Abdallah\n references her Levantine lineage in the form of magic carpets, intimate weaving, and needle art practices. Abdallah seeks to create safe, mobile spaces in the face of occupying forces that cruelly and catastrophically fail humanity. She views the threaded needle as a tool of solidarity to rip through borders, unravel fictive allegories, and heal holes in tender hearts. Abdallah holds Bachelor\u2019s degrees from University of Massachusetts in Anthropology (emphasis in Historical & Collaborative Archaeology, which included field schools with New England indigenous tribal communities); and another in Studio Art with honors, including a Minor in Women\u2019s, Gender & Sexuality Studies. Abdallah also earned an MFA in Fine Arts with distinction from Pratt Institute. Her work as an artist, curator, writer, and educator is rooted in social engagement and collaborative work with various communities and DIY spaces including ABC No Rio; Art in Odd Places; Flux Factory; and Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space. She has been a visiting and teaching artist at institutions including New Museum; Pratt Institute; Sarah Lawrence; Residency Unlimited; BRIC; Kean University; Parsons; Children\u2019s Museum of NYC; El Barrio Artspace; Fairleigh Dickinson; and University of Massachusetts.\u00a0\n\n\nDancers for Palestine\n (D4P) is an autonomous group of dance workers who organize in solidarity with the global movement for Palestinian liberation. Formed during Israel\u2019s genocidal attack on Gaza beginning in 2023, D4P seeks to both cohere and create a dance community which is vocal and active in its support of the Palestinian people. D4P is a local and international endeavor with a core organizing group in NYC and an ever expanding network of dancers and organizers. D4P\u2019s work has included protest and direct action, political education events, art-based fundraising, and campaigns to move dance institutions into alignment with the Palestinian Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.\n\n\nFiber Friends of Falastin\n is an exploratory social activity for folks who have basic crochet, knitting, sewing, quilting, weaving, embroidery, (and more!) skills. Taking place at Interference Archive, this is open to all who are interested in building community at the intersection of textile-making and social movements, where work is created in support of Palestine.\u00a0\n\n\nSam Sundos\n is a Palestinian-American interdisciplinary artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY. Through his paintings & textiles Sundos references his experience as a Palestinian born & raised in diaspora while applying the use of traditional slow craft processes and cultural iconography. Through incorporating his personal experience to these processes Sundos\u2019 hopes to use his voice to advance conversations centering around imperialism & its socioeconomic effects while remaining grounded in themes of indigeneity & tradition. In short, through his art, Sundos seeks to convey the significance of human touch and the value of every human life. Sundos has also recently founded \nUnibrow Sun\n, an organization prioritizing artists & activists whose work is focused on elevating narratives of solidarity through exhibitions, screening, workshops & printed material.\n\n\nTheater Workers for a Ceasefire\n exists to organize U.S.-based theater workers in solidarity with the people of Palestine. We aim to use our bodies and talents in pursuit of a comprehensive ceasefire, which we understand is merely the first step among many in realizing a Free Palestine.",

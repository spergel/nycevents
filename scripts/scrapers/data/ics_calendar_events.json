Who is collecting, analyzing, and presenting data - how and why? These are the hard-hitting questions we will unpack in an open format discussion. If you have been looking for a space to share and engage with multiple perspectives through concrete examples of data’s influence within climate and energy decision-making, this event is for you!​*Note: This is a small group discussion so that we can dive deep into Data In Power principles and examples while building relationships. If you are interested, please RSVP even if the event is full, so that I can plan more for the calendar.​Data In Power is an independently run meetup without any bells and whistles. To maintain our community and sustain organic growth, please support our venue with a refreshment purchase and join the group to share perspectives on the dynamic between data and decision-making.",

      "description": "​Join us for a visit to the Lubalin Archives at The Cooper Union.The Lubalin Center preserves the work of Herb Lubalin and other designers through an archive that includes drawings, type specimens, posters, logos, and advertising materials. Lubalin is a goated American Graphic Designer and this growing archive contain works not only by him but also Paul Rand, Milton Glaser, Massimo Vignelli, and many others.​The archive isn’t digitized so you literally won’t be able to find its stuff on are.na, Pinterest, google images etc. We’re moving beyond aesthetics and engaging with materiality and context, folks! As someone who has visited the archives, I’d say it contains some of the best design references in the country.​We’re getting a hands-on presentation of a selection of material which lasts about an hour and a half. The presentation is different every time and tailored to the group, so even if you’ve been to the archives before, it’s unlikely that the presentation will be the same. It's a closer look at some of the objects in the collection, the stories behind them, and what they can teach us about making work today. The emphasis is on ways we can make active use of design history as contemporary practitioners. The curators will use physical examples from the collection to construct specific case studies of ways we can look at objects to inform today's design decisions.​The Center usually doesn’t host groups past 3 PM, but they’ve graciously agreed to keep the archive open for us until 6 PM on Friday, allowing for a 4 PM start. You may need to leave work a little early, but it’s a Friday and well worth it.",

      "description": "https://lu.ma/43m8iiy5\n\n\u200bThe cabbage Salon is a space for curious minds, deep discussions, and unexpected connections. Each gathering brings people together to engage with big ideas\u2014guided by a speaker, and shaped by the thoughts, experiences, and perspectives of everyone in the room.\n\n\u200bNo academic background required\u2014just a willingness to think, share, and listen.\n\n\u200bThis salon is inspired by the texts of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Thomas Nagel, Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, and Robert Nozick.*\n\n\u200bThe Self\u2026\n\n\u200bWe take for granted that each of us has a self\u2014an \u201cI.\u201d The \u201cI\u201d in \u201cI see the tree\u201d or \u201cI like this band.\u201d But if we take a closer look, the \u201cI\u201d, that we are, becomes strangely elusive: If we try to focus on our pure \u201cI\u201d\u2014stripped of any thought beyond the self-aware \u201cI\u201d\u2014it slips from our grasp. The closer we try to get to it, the further it moves away. Trippy! What can we learn from philosophy about the nature of the self?\n\n\u200b...and Other Drgs**\n\n\u200bWhat are we seeking when we take mind-altering substances? The list of possible answers is long: self-improvement, self-destruction, self-purification... Do we seek liberation, community, chaos, or the unknown? None of the above? And what if there were a drg\u2014inexpensive, free from side effects\u2014that simply made us happier? Should we take it? Why\u2014or why not? \n\n\u200bPresented By:\n\n\u200bGeorg Spoo, PhD. is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy, who practiced his Postdoc at Columbia University. His academic research focus is on epistemology, social and political philosophy, and existentialism. He currently consults with companies to incorporate philosophical ideas into the practical business world. Teams have benefitted from Georg\u2019s discussions on the philosophy of decision-making so they\u2019re equipped to make better ones. At the heart of Georg\u2019s beliefs is that everyone should live in peace, and no one should have to suffer inequality.\n\n\u200bHow We Do Things:\n\n\u200b\ud83d\udd39 Warm-Up: We start with a short icebreaker to get minds moving and ideas flowing.\n\ud83d\udd39 Talk & Discussion: Our guest speaker introduces the theme, sharing insights and questions to consider.\n\ud83d\udd39 Group Conversations: Attendees break into small groups to explore the topic, bringing their own ideas and experiences into the mix.\n\ud83d\udd39 More Talk, More Conversation: Our speaker presents a second round of thoughts, deepening the discussion before another round of open dialogue.\n\ud83d\udd39 Final Thoughts & Closing: We wrap up with reflections, takeaways, and an open floor for last thoughts.\n\n\u200bThis is not a lecture\u2014it\u2019s a conversation. Bring your point of view, your questions, and your curiosity. Get weird, get controversial, get real, baby. \n\n\u200bCome for the ideas, stay for the drinks, lovers, and friends. \ud83c\udf77\n\n\u200b*If you'd like to dig deeper on these texts, it is absolutely not required and you won't feel lost if you haven't. But we've put them together for you here, anyways.\n\n\u200b**idk what the rules of the Internet are these days please don't clown us for censoring\n\n\u200b***Seating is limited, so first come first serve. But standing is good for you, someone said somewhere once.\n\n\u200b****If cost is an issue, please reach out @cabbagehousekids, everyone is welcome!",
